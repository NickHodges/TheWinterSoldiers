# Chapter 5
"Gospodin!"
Hans hit out through the darkness at the hand on his shoulder.
"It is Sergei, Gospodin. You are having a bad dream." He lifted
his hand. "Are you all right?"
Hans lay still blinking through the darkness, still not sure
where he was. But he knew he was all right. He could move and
there was no pain.
"Are you all right?" Sergei asked again.
"Yes."
A warm breeze was coming through the open windows and enough
moonlight streamed in to keep them from having to put up the black-
out curtains to turn on the light. There was no guttering candle,
no stink, no pain and no Russian shells shaking the earth and mak-
ing concrete dust fall in streams from the ceiling of the cellar.
It was quiet. He was in France. His muscles relaxed.
"You must get up, please. You are wet with sweating and so
are the sheets. You must be dry and warm or you will be ill
again."
But Hans' feet felt too heavy to move so he just lay there.
He had heard Annaliese's voice in his dream, calling to him, lift-
ing him above the pain of that cellar in Stalingrad. He had been
trying to get to her but Schuster and Schmidt had pulled him back,
telling him it wasn't time to go. He tried to hang on to the com-
fort of her voice but the images faded and the sound of it left
him. There was a terrible sorrow in that.
"Please, sit up," Sergei said and Hans felt a hand under his
back. He made the effort it took to swing his legs over the side
of the bed. In one swift motion, Sergei helped him swing around,
lifted him to his feet and handed him a towel.
They worked in silence, Hans stripping and toweling himself
down, Sergei changing the bed.
When Sergei was done, he asked Hans if he needed anything
more.
"No." Hans pulled on an undershirt over his head. "Thank you
very much."
"You're welcome. I'm sad about your dream. Such dreams are
bad things. Many men have them now, I think."
"I'm sure they do," Hans said, wearily.
Sergei was just standing there. Hans wanted him to go away,
to leave him alone to sleep, if he could.
"I would like to say, sir, that when I have bad thoughts and
cannot sleep from such a dream, I try to relive one of the nicest
days of my life."
"And just what does such a day consist of?"
"The best is the day I went fishing by Lake Ladoga with my
father," he said with dignity. "I did not have many whole days
with my father. He was away a great deal."
"I'm sorry."
"So am I," Sergei said briskly. "Is there anything more you
require?"
"Nothing. Thank you. I appreciate what you've done."
Hans saw his nod of acknowledgment and then Sergei was gone.
The nicest day of my life, Hans thought bitterly and thrust
all thoughts of Annaliese aside. The pain of thinking about her
was too physical to be borne.
He went to the tray on the small table beside the windows
where there were clean glasses and two bottles, one, half finished,
of wine and one of brandy. He poured himself two fingers of
brandy.
Sergei's words came again, "... one of the nicest days of my
life." At the moment he couldn't think of a nice day, His mind
was a blank.
But then a small picture appeared in the center of the black-
ness. Originally it was too small to be seen, but as he stood,
glass in hand, it grew until it became bigger than life, surround-
ing him, covering his whole range of vision. The colors were vivid
and he could smell the smells and hear the sounds. The sweet smell
of new mown hay was in the air, and there were other smells, dust,
a bit of pine, boy sweat.  He felt the itch of that sweat as it
turned the dust on his skin to fine body mud. He saw the gray of
the stone of the kitchen garden wall, and all of the greens, the
trees in the forest that stretched off to the south for miles, the
individual trees that surrounded the mass of Karl's stone house and
the green of the long lawn in front of it. He could feel the cool
of that grass against his face as he lay on it. Bees feasted in
the flower beds in the gardens behind and in front of the house.
And there were sounds: birds in profusion; the wind in the trees;
laughter; shouts. Each sound was separate and distinct from any
other sound. It wasn't noise. They were sounds, wonderful sounds.
He lowered the glass to the table.
It was 16 years before. He was 12 years old; it was summer;
and he was on Karl's estate in East Prussia. His brother James was
there, a solidly built 16 year old. James was laughing and there
was a smudge of dirt on his face. Peter was there, too, their 13
year old cousin, over from America to be with them for the summer.
They were playing cricket.
Their mother had groaned when she opened the James' trunk and
saw a cricket bat, stumps and bales for two sets of wickets and six
or so cricket balls smashing down the carefully packed clothes.
But then she laughed, shook her head and said, "James" in the way
she had that told him how much she loved him. She lifted it all
out and handed it over to him, telling him to take it out to the
tack room where it would be out of the way.
James had decided he was going to be the best cricketeer in
school and that his brother and Peter were going to help him.
Peter had seen cricket played only once, when he was visiting
them in London. Being the good baseball player he was, at first he
tried to swing the cricket bat like a baseball bat, but he soon
caught on and began advancing the bat carefully toward the ball.
He was tall and strong, taller and stronger than James even though
he was three years younger. Even at 13, he was very well coordi-
nated.
John, on the other hand, was small for his age, but he was
quick and had a knack as a bowler. He was beginning to be able to
throw a googley that could give James fits, when it was on.
They had started playing right after lunch in front of the
stone wall that ran around the kitchen garden and the green house
so that they wouldn't need a wicket keeper. As was to be expected,
James batted first, with Peter fielding and John bowling. James
practiced blocking and ball placement, working to keep the ball
within the boundaries they had set. But finally he saw they were
getting restless and starting lobbing the ball so they could get
him out.
That was the day when things came together for John for the
first time. He was batting better than he ever had, especially
when Peter was bowling; catching everything that came his way, rol-
ling sliding, coming up with the ball clutched in his hand when it
shouldn't have been possible; and bowling better than he ever had.
After tea, Karl came out with them and fielded for a time
though he had never played, never even seen cricket played. He did
remarkably well at fielding. Finally he couldn't resist and asked
for a turn at bat.
John was the bowler and he went easy on him because he thought
he would be hopeless. But Karl managed to block a remarkable num-
ber of bowls before he was finally bowled out.
Just as he went back into the field, Otto appeared and said
there was a call from Berlin. Karl hurried off and they were sorry
to see him go. Their eyes followed him and there were sideways
grins at each other because the "old man" had done well, though of
course they hadn't presumed to tell him that.
They played on, swapping batsmen whenever someone was out. It
was getting dark when John came up for what they all knew would be
the turn. He was blocking and hitting well, but suddenly he got
tired of placement and simply hit it. There was a wonderful sharp
crack and the ball went way off into the woods on the left. They
all ran to the spot at the edge of the woods where it had gone in.
John dropped the bat and left it there while they all went into the
gloom under the trees and shuffled carefully through the mat of
leaves on the forest floor, each trying to be the one who found it.
They all saw the ball at the same time, propped up against the ele-
vated roots of an oak and ran toward it, each wanting to be the
first to get it.  They collapsed in a heap, grabbing, then falling
back laughing as John came up with it.
Hans found himself longing for them and for a time when life
was so uncomplicated and all things were possible. And for a time
when there was always next summer.
He let his mind go blank again and this time he was at Peter's
family's summer cottage on Lake Erie, near Conneaut. He was moving
in a stream of liquid clay as he made his way down the face of the
cliff while cliff swallows swooped and soared.  A few years later
he had had his first sexual experience in the tall grass at the top
of that same cliff. He had been breathless and clumsy and utterly
in love. And now he couldn't even remember her name.
The next morning, Sergei hung the colonel's shirt in the
closet. When he was done, he looked around to make sure everything
was as it should be. Sergei liked these rooms. They were the nic-
est room he'd been in, other than the colonel general's house,
since he and his mother had been forced to leave Leningrad. The
furniture was a bit shabby, probably because of the war, but it was
comfortable, and the rooms themselves were spacious with long
leaded windows that let in a great deal of light.
The view from Sergei's narrow room and from the colonel's bed-
room was limited, looking out over the back grounds of the hotel.
There was a small garden and a gravel courtyard in front of a long
garage which used to be stables and which had rooms for the hotel's
help and the drivers across the top. But the sitting room windows
looked out across a broad agricultural valley toward Caen to the
west. It was a long view and he found it liberating to be able to
look that far. At least he did when he was alone and he was alone
a great deal. He was used to that, but there were times when he
would have liked someone to talk to, someone who might become a
friend. He doubted that was possible here.
Most of the German enlisted men he knew were men not unlike
himself, though usually not as well educated. Not that that mat-
tered to him. Sergei was a man who got along well with almost
everyone. He had always had a lot of friends but they were Russian
friends, men who instinctively understood what he was talking
about, men with common assumptions about life and a common hatred
of Stalin and what he was doing to Russia.
There was a battalion of Russians stationed a few miles to the
east. He could have gone to see them any time, to talk Russian and
eat Russian food because they were supposed to have an excellent
Russian cook. But he didn't want to see them. Their world was
even less real than his because they were trying to create a Rus-
sian world where it didn't belong, a Russia in France created by
men who had taken the German schilling to save their own lives, who
had become traitors to Russia for their own profit, It shamed him,
especially because he considered himself one of them.
He wore a German uniform, ate German food, drove a German
officer in a German car, was even learning to talk German reason-
ably well. So he, too, had taken the German schilling, even if he
wouldn't fight for Germany. But no matter what he did, even if he
lived in Germany for the rest of his life, he would never be Ger-
man. The Germans didn't want him and he didn't want them.
He found their world insane, even more insane than the world
he had left because at least his friends in Russia were united in
recognizing that insanity. If the enlisted men he knew in the Ger-
man army recognized that insanity, they weren't talking about it,
at least not to him. Even the colonel and the colonel general
hadn't said anything to him directly, but he knew they hated what
was happening in Germany, just as he knew they were trying to do
something about that hatred. He wasn't sure what they were plan-
ning, but he guessed that it had to mean killing Adolf Hitler.
That was sanity for Sergei in an insane German world. Sergei hoped
with a viciousness that was rare for him, that they would succeed.
They were good men.
The colonel general had taken him into his own home, then seen
to it that he was assigned to a place where he might be able to
surrender to the English when the fighting did come. It had not
escaped Sergei's notice that this was possible only because he had
seen to it that the colonel was assigned to such a place as well.
He found that very interesting.
He was startled out of his thoughts by a voice coming from the
doorway. "Sergei?"
"Yes, Captain Schmidt."
"I have some letters the colonel would like to have locked up
in his desk." He walked into the sitting room holding them out.
"They're personal."
"Thank you." Sergei stood there holding them, not wanting to
emphasize the fact that he had a key to the desk while Schmidt did
not.
"Are you finding everything you need?" Schmidt always spoke
German slowly and carefully which made him easier to understand.
"I need new tires for the staff car. Is such a thing pos-
sible?" He had learned fast that very few things were impossible
for Schmidt.
"Of course," Schmidt said stiffly.
"I did not mean..."
"Of course, of course." Schmidt waved a hand to indicate that
it was nothing. "It's just ... We have been here for eight days
and this afternoon we all have to present our reports to the colo-
nel."
Because they were speaking German, Schmidt had to say it a
second time before Sergei fully understood. When he did under-
stand, Sergei was surprised.  "You are afraid?" The words came out
before he had time to consider them.
Schmidt's face reddened. "No." Then he shifted from one foot
to the other and shrugged. "It's the first real report I've ever
had to make."
"The first time for anything is difficult." Sergei hesitated.
"You and Major Schuster and the colonel have been together for a
long time. If you wouldn't mind, some time when you have time,
would you tell me about that time? I would like to know." It had
occurred to him more than once that Schmidt might have the answer
to the dreams. It would help him to help the colonel if he knew
what it was all about.
"I do have a little time now," Schmidt said doubtfully.
And you don't want to think about this report you have prob-
ably been staying up late at night to finish, Sergei thought,
because you are afraid Majors Wagner and von Feber will laugh at it
and you behind your back. "And I have nothing more to do here.
The colonel is a very neat man. Shall I get some beer and we can
sit by the river?"
"Fine. It is a nice day." Schmidt looked relieved and Sergei
knew it was because the river bank was secluded and it did not do
for a German officer to seem to be too friendly with an enlisted
man, especially a Russian enlisted man. The thought made him sad.
He was beginning to like Schmidt, and he could see that Schmidt was
not comfortable as an officer. That made Schmidt lonely and lone-
liness could be very difficult.

Fifteen minutes later they were sitting by the river.
Sergei was on the ground, leaning against the tree that was
shading him, beer bottle in hand, four more beside him on the
ground along with the German-Russian dictionary Karl von der Greif
had given him before he left Berlin. It was the colonel general's
own - His name was in it. - and it was old, worn and very well-
used. He said he had carried it with him in Russia, between the
wars. Though Sergei wished it was smaller so he could carry it in
his pocket, he wanted no other. It was, to him, both a great kind-
ness and something that he could relate to the colonel general's
association with his father.
Schmidt was sitting in an old wooden kitchen chair, leaning
the back of it against the same tree, beer bottle in hand, staring
off into the distance. He was not a big man, only marginally
taller than Hans Richter, but far heavier, stocky without being
fat. He had black hair smoothed back close to his head, dark eyes,
high cheek bones and a small mouth all set a bit too much in the
middle of a round face. It was a closed face, one that didn't give
much away.
"What do you want to know?" Schmidt asked abruptly.
"It is ...," Sergei sighed. While he was beginning to under-
stand what was said to him, it was still hard for him to express
himself in German. "I don't like talking about this since it is
the colonel's business, but I worry. He has bad dreams. They
upset him very much.  He cries out and hits the wall and he
sweats. I can't understand much of what he says, but I know he is
afraid. And he is in pain, I think. There are bombs falling and
he calls the name of his wife. But he also calls your name and
Major Schuster's. That is why I ask you."
Sergei looked up and saw Schmidt's profile. His face was very
still.
"I wish to help him," Sergei said softly.
Schmidt nodded.
Sergei accepted the silence. He just sat, drank his beer and
looked off into the distance while he waited.
"We have been together for a long time." Schmidt said slowly.
"Schuster and I were in his tank crew in France in 1940. There was
a break of a year and a half, then Russia." There was another
silence as he drank his beer and contemplated. "Are there rats?"
Schmidt's voice was hoarse.
"Yes," Sergei said in surprise. "There are also rats."
"They were everywhere," Schmidt said.
Sergei could see he was sweating which surprised him. It was
not a hot day.
"You could hear them rustling around, see those little yellow
eyes burning in the dark if you had a candle. It got so I almost
hated candles, but you needed to see them when they came. Schuster
and I ... One of us was awake most of the time to keep the rats off
him and off each other. But finally we got smart. Food was so
short and Schuster is clever. He was raised on a farm."  He put
down his empty beer bottle and reached for another. Sergei popped
the top off a full one and handed it to him. He took it without
noticing.
"He made a trap and we caught them. Then we waited until a
building was on fire or someone had found enough wood to start one.
It was so cold." He shuddered. "We'd kill what we had and clean
and roast them. I'm sure that's how I got dysentery. They were
covered with fleas."
"There was no food by that time, unless you call a little
flour mixed with saw dust or wallpaper paste food." Schmidt took a
long swallow of beer then wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand. "After Hans had his we would share out with the other men in
the cellar. - There were eight of us. - and they would help out
with Hans, too, if we asked. But sometimes others would come and
occasionally there were fights. Other men were starving and wanted
to take what we had. If there was enough, we'd share but more
often there wasn't. Schuster would show them how to make traps, if
that was possible, if it wasn't ..." He shrugged. "Rats don't
taste too bad, if you cook them right. And these were fat rats.
They fed off the dead, and there were plenty of dead." He twisted
uncomfortably in the chair. "I didn't like that part. It made me
feel like a cannibal. But if it weren't for the rats, all three of
us would have died." He concentrated on picking small pieces of
lint off his trousers.
"But you want to know about the colonel's dreams. The bombs
weren't bombs. We were being shelled. I thought to myself that
the Russians must have cornered the market on shells. Two, three
times a day and often at night. There was no getting away from it.
It was so cold and there was no food and precious few shells to
fire back. Even ammunition for the rifles was rationed. No shoot-
ing unless the target was there. Everything rationed. Medical
supplies. Major Brandt was really upset about it. He said there
was almost nothing. No medicines. Only paper bandages. No fuel
to sterilize anything, so they used alcohol and reused it, more
often than was safe. And there were no more surgical gloves so the
surgeons used the same alcohol to sterilize their hands, too. The
cases there was no way to treat were put in a hall at the far end
of the building we were using for a hospital. Just in the
hall. On stretchers along the walls. As people at the end of the
hall died, the others were moved farther and farther down the hall
to make room for more, until they died, too. Everyone in the hall
died. They froze to death because the hall opened out on nothing.
The end of the building was bombed out and that's where the hall
went. Into the bombed out nothing. It was supposed to be humane
that way. Let them freeze. You're not supposed to feel anything
when you freeze, but you do. I nearly froze once. Everything
hurts." Schmidt was sweating and his face was red. "It would be
more humane just to kill them, but who would do it? Especially
since there was not enough ammunition to shoot them. It would have
to be done with a knife, and who could do that? Who could kill so
many helpless men with a knife? It would have been terrible for
morale.
"That's where we found him," Schmidt said quietly after a long
pause. "The colonel was in the hall, half way down. His leg wound
was badly infected and since there were no bandages or medicine,
there was nothing they could do for him.
"He was taken to the hospital right after he was hit but when
we went to see him the next day, we couldn't find him. He was just
gone and no one would say where he was until one of the medics
mumbled something about the hall. I didn't know what he was talk-
ing about, but Schuster knew. His face was white. I'd never seen
him like that. He wouldn't explain. He just pulled at me, made me
go with him. Wouldn't say a word. That scared me more than any-
thing else could have. And when I saw all those men, lying there
..." He wiped his hand down his face. "All of them in rags, most
in pain, whimpering. Cold. My God, it was cold. And the stink."
He lifted his face to the sky and Sergei could see that there were
tears in his eyes. "Hans was almost half way down. A lot of men
must have died." He took a long pull on the beer. "He was deliri-
ous. He had a paper bandage on his leg. It was so ... filthy. He
was so filthy. Awful. There was only one thin blanket over him."
His hands twitched around the beer bottle and he turned to look at
Sergei at last. "If he was supposed to die, why did they bother
with a blanket?"
Sergei looked at his feet. The lack of German words frus-
trated him and since he didn't know how to say what he wanted to
say, he said nothing.
Schmidt looked away, his eyes roving the countryside and
beyond. "We took him away. They didn't try to stop us. That was
good. We would have fought." He sighed. "Schuster found a clean
shirt. God knows where. He would never say. There wasn't any-
thing clean in Stalingrad. We got wood, - It wasn't easy. - boiled
some water in my helmet and Schuster cleaned the wound. He knows
about such things. He sterilized his knife in the fire and cut
away the dead tissue. I can still see him, hunched over Hans' leg.
He was so careful but it hurt Hans so much. We had nothing to give
him for the pain, but if Schuster hadn't done it, Hans would have
lost his leg. At least that's what Dr. Brandt said. Schuster was
worried that he had done the wrong thing, so he asked Dr. Brandt.
We had done everything right." There was pride in his voice. "I
got him a great coat, something to wrap him in, to keep him warm.
The man I got it from was dead. The dead were stripped almost as
they fell. Boots especially. But Hans had good boots. They had
taken his coat but he still had his boots. His feet are smaller
than most men's, so there must have been no one else they would
fit." The empty beer bottle went round and round between his
hands.
Sergei opened another, took the empty and replaced it without
Schmidt even knowing.
"It was almost too late," Schmidt said. "By that time, he had
pneumonia. Even so, we had to leave him part of the time. As I
said, there were other men in the cellar and they would watch him
sometimes, but they couldn't always. Too tired. We still had to
fight, to help defend the area.  Seven days later, Major Brandt
appeared. He just appeared. I'll never know how he found us. It
was almost frightening. He was so clean, so healthy looking. It
made me realize ..." He shook his head and took a long swallow of
his beer. "There were two guards with him. He had a back pack
filled with iron rations and medical supplies. My God. We divided
the food with everyone in the cellar, including his guards. There
wasn't too much but it seemed like a feast. Nothing ever tasted so
good." He laughed. It was a short sharp sound. "Major Brandt
wouldn't touch anything. He said it was for us. Then he went to
Hans. I couldn't watch. I knew what he'd see. He was very quiet.
Schuster helped him. Said there were tears streaming down his face
but his hands didn't waver. He had morphine with him. Gave Hans
some. Hans was lucid but he didn't think he was because Major
Brandt was there.
"When he finally realized it really was the major and that the
colonel general had come and was going to take him out ... Schus-
ter told me, Hans said he wouldn't go, not unless Schuster and I
came with him."
Schmidt took in a long ragged breath. "We got out to the air-
port in a truck full of wounded. They were still taking out
wounded then, at least some. The ones they were sure would live
even though they couldn't fight. But by then everyone wanted to
get out and there weren't enough planes. There were never enough
planes. That was why we were starving. So sometimes men would
fight, the walking wounded trampling on the stretcher cases to get
on the planes that were going back for more supplies.
"Schuster and Hans and Major Brandt and I were sent to the
other side of the air field in the ruins of a hanger to wait. The
colonel general and Major Pflueger met us there. The colonel gen-
eral's plane was to taxi over to get us. We still had our rifles.
No one ever let go of his rifle in Stalingrad. He told us ..." He
cleared his throat. "The Colonel General told Majors Brandt and
Pflueger to carry the stretcher, told us to have our rifles at the
ready. He took out his Luger. Said we needed to be ready to
shoot. I did as I was told but I couldn't believe it. The plane
taxied toward us and there were men chasing it because it was
empty. They had rifles. We had to shoot."
He stopped and sat up straight, looking around almost as if he
was surprised to see where he was. "I have talked too much." He
leaned forward, his hand on his thigh, his face hard. "You are
Russian. We fight Russians. We kill Russians."
"Yes," said Sergei carefully. "And Russians do the same to
Germans because Adolf Hitler chooses that you come to take our land
so there is room for Germany to expand. Do you want Russian land?"
Schmidt looked away.
"I think you do not," said Sergei. "I think you would like to
go back to the wife and son you love so much and run work in the
store that your father must work in though he is old and sick. I
do not want Russian land any more myself. Josef Stalin killed my
father and ruined my mother's life. She could not go back to her
family in England after he was killed. They wanted her to come but
the government would not let her, would not even tell her the fam-
ily wanted her back until after she died.
"I fight for Russia because I must. I fight or I die. They
will kill me if I do not fight. There was a gun at my back to make
me go and fight. I think it is very strange that men must put guns
at the backs of other men so they will kill other men so the kill-
ing can stop. War is stupid. If Germany takes Russia, what will
you do with it? No one in the Soviet Union will like that. They
will fight anyone who comes and many men will die and women and
children. That is not peace. Only if everyone stays at home and
refuses to kill anyone else will war stop.
"I think you have had to kill many men. It is the way tanks
are."
Schmidt was looking at his feet. He made no sound, no ges-
ture, no movement at all.
Sergei was frustrated by the difficulty he was having express-
ing himself, and knew he had to sound like an ignorant fool but he
persisted because he really wanted Schmidt to understand.
"I have killed men. They shoot at me. I shoot at them. I do
not like it but the men are not near to me so I am able to do it.
But there was one who made me stop. I kill him close. He is
young. He is frightened. I am frightened. He is wounded. I
would leave him there but he come at me to kill me so I must kill
him. I stick my bayonet in him. He scream, so I do it again and
again until he stop. Then I run and kill some more but I do not
look at their faces. But that one, he was young like me and I see
his face. I dream his face and hear him scream. He is like me. I
do not want to kill any more men like me.
"You are a man like me. You kill men but you do not like it,
I think. That is a good thing you did, saving the colonel. I
think you like doing that. I wish to help the colonel. You tell
me ... I understand many things now. I wish to help him so I
thank you. You did not say too much. I will say nothing of what
you say to me. It is the colonel's business and I do not wish to
talk his business or yours with anyone. But I talk with you
because he calls your name in his dreams and I think you are a man
I can talk to about such things." He rose slowly, dictionary in
hand, then stooped to pick up all the bottles he could.  "I think
you have luck. You have the colonel and you have Major Schuster.
You take care of each other for a long time. And when the war is
over, you have a family to go back to and you can rebuild your
store in the same place if it is bombed."
"Do you have any family?" Schmidt looked up at Sergei sharply.
"My father's parents die in the revolution. He is their only
child. I am his only child. My mother's family, they are in
England, as I said. I have never seen them."
"And you don't want to live in Russia any more."
"I cannot live in Russia any more," he said simply. "Now that
I am here, if I go back there, they will kill me. But that is dif-
ferent, I think, than what you ask. I do not want to live there
any more and so now because I make the choice to come out of the
prisoner camp, I cannot live there any more. Do you understand?"
"Yes." Schmidt's mouth tightened briefly, making his lips
disappear. He rose, then stooped to pick up the rest of the
bottles. "I have to get to headquarters. Get ready for the meet-
ing."  Then he put himself in front of Sergei and looked up at
him. "You are right. This war is shit. It's all shit, all the
killing, all the destruction and for what?
"I never thought of it before, but you're right, what would we
do with Russia if we did conquer it? It would eat us alive. And
if you tell anyone I said that..."
Sergei saw anger, then fear in Schmidt's face. He shook his
head. "I do not talk about such things. It is dangerous."
