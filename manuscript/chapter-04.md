# Chapter 4
Hans was walking in Karl von der Greif's large back garden,
hands stuffed in the pockets of his jacket, head down, toe scuf-
fing at small spots of snow mold from  time to time as he moved
along. He was "taking the air" as Georg Brandt had ordered him to
do.
It was a cold damp day in late March.  The sun shone weakly
whenever it appeared from behind the mountains of pristine cumulus
that were gliding across the sky.  There were ice blue carpets of
crocuses under the low-sweeping branches of the copper beeches and
a haze of green softened the stark out-lines of the lindens and
oaks.
"You can see anyone you want to see, but you will see them
here," Karl had said.  "We'll say you had a relapse.  Everyone
will believe it because half the general staff saw you faint in
that damn hallway, so you have the perfect excuse for staying
right here. And you will stay right here until we can get you out
of town."
But there was also Georg saying, "Get outside, walk, get exer-
cise, fresh air. I don't like the way you look.  Not physically,"
he said with a deprecatory wave of the hand.  "Physically you're
much better, but you look like a death's head.  And you're not
yourself.  You spend too much time sitting around feeling sorry
for yourself.  You don't laugh any more.  Rarely even smile.  Get
out of the house.  Move.  Walk.  Find something else to think
about."
So Hans was obeying doctor's orders.  He was out of the house
and he was walking, after a fashion, even if it was only within
Karl's two acre back garden.  But he still hadn't found "something
else" to think about.
He scuffed at yet another patch of snow mold, then looked
around, noticing all the small patches of it as if for the first
time.  This winter had been hard on the lawn, but then, he thought
bitterly, this winter had been hard on everyone and everything.
The only good thing that could be said about the winter of l942-43
was that it was almost over.
He went back to kicking at the grass, wondering idly what the
spring and summer would bring, then sneered at himself because it
really didn't matter.  Nothing mattered, because wherever he went,
whatever he did, he would take his loneliness and sense of futil-
ity with him.  Hitler was alive and Annaliese was dead.
He had told Michael that he knew Annaliese's death was not his
fault, but he was able to believe that only sporadically.  If it
had not been for him, she would not have been in England.  If it
hadn't been for him, she wouldn't have gotten pregnant, wouldn't
have been delivering their son, hidden away in a small private
hospital in north London because they couldn't be seen in that
city.  There could be spies everywhere.  And if she had not been
in that particular hospital on that particular night, delivering
at that particular moment, she would still be alive.
He saw it again, as he too often did.  The building shaking,
plaster cracking, falling.  At the first too familiar sound, he
was on the floor, rolling under one of the heavy wooden benches in
the waiting room.  It stopped almost as soon as it started.  He
moved fast, but not fast enough.  A nurse was sitting on the floor
of the hall looking dazed, blood coming from one ear.  "Where's
the delivery room?"  She looked at him in confusion.  He shook
her, asking again.  She pointed.  He looked up and felt terror.
There was a pile of rubble where the hall should have had been.
He started on the rubble, throwing pieces behind him, not
thinking or caring where they might go.  Soon his fingers were
raw, bleeding.  Then there was someone helping, - He never saw
who. - then someone else.
Finally he was able to scrabble across into the delivery room.
Annaliese was still strapped to the table, her heels in the stir-
rups, legs and torso draped for delivery.  Between her legs, all
was open, exposed, and covered with dust.
She saw him, held out her arms and cried to him to save the
baby.  The rest of the room was a mess of fallen masonry and
beams.  The nurse was dead.  The doctor was unconscious.  He was
lying on his side under a beam, curled into the fetal position
around the baby, shielding the him with his own body.
The baby lived but Annaliese died five days later from a mas-
sive infection caused by the dust.
He still had trouble believing she was dead even though he had
seen her lying in her coffin, her face a waxy white, unnatural,
still.
She had loved him, wanted him, accepted him and wherever she
had been was home, the only real home he had known since 1936.
Now all of that gone.
The pain of that constricted his chest and made it hard to
breathe.
But on the heels of pain came rage and he cursed her for
dying, cursed the infection for killing her.  It would have been
better if she had been killed by the bomb.  No one could fight a
bomb, but anyone could fight an infection.  He cursed her for not
being strong enough to fight it, cursed the fact that there was no
one who could help her fight it, that he couldn't help her fight
it.  There had been nothing he could do, nothing at all.
The rage passed and it was as if he had fallen into a black
hole.  He sank onto a bench, his mind working in slow motion.  She
had given life and gained death.  The doctor had lived despite a
concussion, a broken shoulder and the cracked ribs that had col-
lapsed his lung.  But the nurse had died and so had Annaliese,
with her hand is his and the baby beside them both.
Tears came.  He brushed at them impatiently and the gesture
reminded him of the baby. A few weeks after he was born Hans had
found his mother leaning over the crib, watching her grandson with
a smile of loving delight.  His little hands were formed into
fists that waved, occasionally brushing his face, more often jab-
bing like a boxer's.  She started laughing and looked up at Hans
with an irrepressible grin.  "Gerhard Friedrich Dieter is far too
imposing a name for this baby.  I think we should call him Punch."
Her laughter faded at the sight of her son's face.  She put
her arms around him and held him.  It was the only time he had
cried, until today.
Hans leaned back, spread his arms along the top of the bench
and lifted his face to the sun, thinking as he did what a hypocrit
he was.  He was cursing Annaliese for not being strong enough to
live when what he wanted most was to die so he could be with her
and well out of everything that meant living in 1943.  But since
he couldn't seem to avoid living, it was well he was going to
France, somewhere different, somewhere were there were no personal
associations with anyone important to him except his cousin Peter.
He remembered the last time they were together and his face sof-
tened.  They had gone on a four week walking tour, hiking, fish-
ing, drinking and laughing their way through the Ardennes, with a
last glorious week in Paris.  He had gone straight from Paris to
Berlin where he had enlisted.  He hadn't told anyone what he was
going to do, not his mother, not James, not even Peter.  He had
gotten a very angry letter from Peter about two months later but
he had never answered it.  He didn't know what to say and even if
he had, he wouldn't have wanted to say it, at least not to Peter.
The next time he had been in France, he was in a tank on a
mission of destruction.  And now he would have to go back there
and face all that destruction.  He didn't like that part of it.
What he did like was the fact that he would be doing something
worthwhile, getting troops ready to stop the civil war that was
sure to come when Adolf Hitler was finally dead.  It was something
he was good at, something that might get him out of the dark hole
he seemed to live in. There wouldn't be time for darkness in
France.  He would see to that.
There was a slight lift to his heart at the thought that Georg
Brandt would be there, and Ulrich Wagner.  He remembered Ulrich's
cheerful homely face, his delight at giving up a safe job as one
of Karl's chief assistants and all the perquisites that went with
it, the way he had lifted his handless left arm and waved it say-
ing, "We both thank you.  Much longer behind that desk and I'd
have gone out of my mind."
But Schuster and Schmidt were coming as well.
The thought made him restless.  He got up, stuffed his hands
into his pockets and started scuffing his way along the gravel
path.  As he thought his feet seemed to lift themselves and his
strides got longer and faster.
Part of the problem was that he wanted them with him.  He
trusted them, cared about them and was comfortable with them
because they knew each others' ways.  They were also honest,
straightforward men, and Schuster at least was a good officer.
Hans had found that the war brought out unexpected talents in a
great many men and felt Schuster was a prime example of that.  The
unsophisticated north German farm boy who had come to war as the
loader in Hans' tank during the battle for France had developed
into a good tactician and a first-rate leader of men.  Schuster
was ready for a regiment, and it gave Hans satisfaction to think
that in France he would have one.  Schuster and Ulrich Wagner
would be his two regimental commanders.
Schmidt was another matter entirely.  He had been the best
sergeant major on his section of the eastern front.  He could
wheel and deal and scrounge with the best of them, but the Wehr-
macht had spoiled it by making him a lieutenant in command of
fighting men.  There had been no choice.  Russia chewed up and
swallowed junior officers faster than they could be replaced and
far too many men were promoted beyond their capabilities.  Schmidt
was one of those and Hans knew that no one knew that better than
Schmidt himself.
Another good thing about France for Hans was that at least he
could give Schmidt a job that suited him, and, oddly enough, it
would mean his promotion from lieutenant to captain.  The aide of
a full colonel needed to be a captain.  Schmidt would run the
office and see that no one got away with anything in the bargain.
On the other hand, Schmidt was shrewd, and if he were running
the office, Hans knew it would be hard to keep him from learning
about the plot.  But he was determined to do it.  The Gestapo was
on the scent.  Anyone caught out would die a horrible death in the
process of the Gestapo getting all the information he had.  The
only safety for both Schuster and Schmidt was in ignorance, so
that no one could implicate them in the process.  But he had to
wonder how safe even that would be when almost everyone around
them was involved. In the Gestapo's eyes, there was guilt by asso-
ciation.
"Gospodin."
Hans stopped abruptly and turned.
"Excuse me, Gospodin."
The man approaching him was enormous, barely contained by the
grey enlisted man's fatigues that he wore.  His black suspenders
were stretched to their absolute limit.  He was broad shouldered
and very tall, 6'6" at least, with the high flat cheeks and nar-
rowed eyes that said Slav. This was echoed by his heavy accent and
the fact that Gospodin was a respectful term of address in Russia.
The man stopped a few feet away and leaned on the large garden
fork he was carrying.  Only two fingers from each hand fit around
the handle, making it disappear.
"I am Sergei Ivanovich Voronov," he said as if that explained
everything.
When Hans didn't reply, the Russian cocked his head and looked
at him carefully.  His eyes were both curious and friendly and it
was then that Hans realized how young he was, certainly no more
than 21 or 22.
"What may I do for you, Sergei Ivanovich Voronov?" he said
finally.
"I am sorry," he said earnestly, "but my German is bad.  I
just begin.  Do you speak Russian or" - his face brightened -
"English?"
"Yes," Hans said slowly.  "I speak English."
"Thank you."  It was as if Hans had conferred a great favor on
him.  "Could you tell me what forsythia is?  I must dig around the
roots so they can ... breathe?  I think that's what the small man
said I must do."
Hans smiled.  He could hear Karl's gardener saying just that.
"There." He pointed to a bright yellow haze.
"Here you are,"  said an angry voice.  It was Gustav, the
gardener. "I'm sorry he's bothering you, Herr Colonel.  Stupid
Russian," he muttered.  "Can't tell them anything."
He grabbed Sergei's arm and tugged.  "Come on."
Hans stood, watching with amusement as the ancient, diminutive
and very bow-legged gardener, poked and pushed at the unprotesting
Russian who could have swatted him away like a fly.  "Wait,
please, Gustav."
"Herr Colonel?"  The old man turned back.
"I'd like to ask him something."  He gestured toward the Rus-
sian.
The old man prodded Sergei, urging him back around. "And stand
up straight when you address an officer."  It was all Hans could
do not to laugh.  Gustav had never gotten over his days as a cor-
poral in the trenches of France during the Great War.
But then he saw the Russian looking at him.
"Why did you call me Gospodin?" Hans asked in English.
"You are of this household."
"Yes," Hans agreed.
"I wish to show respect to the household of Gospodin von der
Greif."
"He is a colonel general."
The Russian nodded.  "And you are a colonel."
"Yes."
"I have no use for the military, Gospodin."  With that he
turned and headed in the direction in which the gardener had been
leading him.
Gustav started to follow, then hesitated and looked back at
Hans in obvious irritation.  "Are you finished with him, sir?"
Hans grinned.  "It would seem so."
Gustav gave a sharp nod and hurried off to make sure that
Sergei Voronov was starting in the right place.
Hans was still smiling as started toward the house, turning
back as he went up the broad steps to the terrace to watch the
obliging Russian trying to respond to Gustav's gesticulations.  By
the time he got to the french doors that led into the library,
Sergei Voronov had begun to dig and Gustav seemed satisfied.
"What do you think of our Russian?" Karl asked as Hans stepped
into the dark paneled gloom of the room.
"Who is he?"
"The son of a Russian liaison officer I got to know when I was
there in the twenties."  Karl was in the corner by the drinks
cabinet and there was the gurgling of schnapps being poured. "The
father was a colonel at the time. Went on to become a general."
Karl lifted the bottle in inquiry.
"Beer, please."
Karl nodded and turned back.
"If his father's a general,  why would he say he has no use
for the military?"
Karl handed Hans a heavy beer stein then knelt and put a match
to the fire which was already laid in the grate.  "His father was
killed in the late thirties, in the last of Stalin's purges of the
Russian officer corps.  At which point the boy's education
stopped, he and his mother lost their luxury apartment in Lenin-
grad, and they were sent into internal exile in Gorky.  She died
there in late 1940." He stood, dusted his hands off on the seat of
his trousers, picked up his drink from the mantel and gestured
impatiently for Hans to take a chair.
"His mother was an English woman who fell in love with the
Russian revolution.  Went to Leningrad to see it and wound up
marrying Voronov.  He was only a major then and a childless
widower.  He was already married to her, of course, when I got to
know him in the twenties.  I was seconded to his unit to help with
their training.  Did it well, it would seem.  Too well," he said
sourly.  "The quid pro quo for the secret training bases they let
us use.
"The mother did an odd thing, when you think what a fan of the
revolution she must have been.  When the boy was born, she regis-
tered him at the British Embassy, such as it was in those days."
Hans' eyebrows went up.  "Which means he could claim British
citizenship, if he wanted to."
"Yes," said Karl.  "And he has had a letter.  It came a few
weeks after his mother died and was addressed to her.  The
powers that be had held it up for months and he felt they wanted
him to know that they had because they didn't bother to block out
the cancellation date.
"Her father had disowned her when she married Voronov but now
this letter arrived from him,  saying that they had heard of Voro-
nov's death and knew that life had to be untenable for her.  They
loved her and missed her and wanted her to come home with Sergei.
He wrote them back, telling of his mother's death.  But he has no
way of knowing if the letter ever got to them.  He's had no reply.
"Then came the war and the boy was plucked from some boring
clerical job he'd been assigned to and thrown into the front lines
after only two weeks of training."  He took a sip of schnapps,
then sighed in satisfaction as he sank into his favorite over-
stuffed leather chair and motioned again for Hans to sit as well.
Hans was still leaning against the door jamb where he could
watch the proceedings.
"You know what the Russians do.  Get their troops drunk.  Seem
to think it's the only way they'll fight." Obviously the thought
disgusted Karl. "But I imagine you know all about that."
"Then they send them over the top, straight  at our lines,
yelling like banshees," Hans said quietly. He was staring into his
half-empty stein.  "Machine guns are trained at their backs, from
their own lines, to prevent ... malingering." He looked
back out into the garden. Gustav was gesticulating wildly,
obviously trying to explain something that the seemingly endlessly
affable Russian couldn't understand.  Hans looked back, his eyes
studying the room as if he had never seen it before.  "Bring me
the bottle."  Karl sounded annoyed suddenly.  "And for God's sake,
sit down.   I need to talk to you."
Hans paused mid-move.  It suddenly occurred to him that for
the first time since what he thought of as That Day, Karl sounded
like himself, gruff, rough, scarcely polite.  The relief was enor-
mous.
Hans handed over the bottle, then sat in the same sort of
chair on the other side of the fireplace and put his feet very
deliberately onto a needle-point covered footstool.  Along with
her antiques, her needlepoint was the pride of Aunt Gretl's life.
It was everywhere in the house, almost ad nauseam, and she
frequently made it plain that all these things were to be used
only with great care, especially by him.
"That's better," Karl grumbled.
Hans nodded and sipped his beer.  It really was better. "So
how did he come to you?"
"His unit was surrounded and he surrendered, luckily before he
could be shot by either side."
"From what I hear about the camps we keep for the Russian
POWs, he's lucky he's still alive."
Karl nodded.  "It's only because he wasn't there long before
Vlasov came recruiting."
"How many Russian prisoners does he get to volunteer?" "Very
few Russians.  Mainly Ukranians and a smattering from every other
dissident nationality in that godforsaken vastness.  They fight
the Russians.  Surprisingly few, given what their chances are of
surviving in those camps.  The Russians never signed the Geneva
convention so we ..."  He turned on Hans.  "That boy made me real-
ize ...  Talked to him at length this morning.  He's a Russian but
not a Russian, you see." He was glaring at Hans, almost daring him
to make something more of it than that.
Karl's words repeated themselves in his ears.  A Russian but
not a Russian.  Just as he was German but not German.  And it was
even more true of him than it was of Sergei Voronov because unlike
the Russian, he hadn't been raised in his father's homeland which
meant he'd never developed that particular set of understandings
and expectations, the mind set that German children absorb by
osmosis as they grow into their heritage.  Therefore, he was Ger-
man, English and American, in that order, and though German had
become paramount, the other parts of him hadn't died off. They
never would.  They were irrevocable.
But he knew that Karl had also told him something else; he
understood.  The generosity of that was remarkable. The beer dis-
solved enough of the lump in his throat to let him ask "How did
this Russian happen to come to you?"
Karl was regarding the fire and his voice seemed to come from
far away.  "His father had told him about me, apparently liked me
as much as I liked him.  My name stuck with him, so when Vlasov
got to his camp, Sergei told him that though he wouldn't fight, he
did want to volunteer his services, but only to me personally, and
Vlasov was intrigued enough to make sure I heard about it.
"When the message got to me, and I realized who he was, I had
him brought to Berlin.  Things being as they are, I couldn't very
well turn him down.  I knew what it would mean.  The camps.  As
you said..."  A shrug. "So I took him on.  A month ago.  He's been
driving Pflueger around until we decide what to do with him."
Hans had never understood why Karl persisted in calling his
son-in-law who was also his aide, Pflueger, especially since he
was obviously so fond of him.
"Pflueger likes him. Has started teaching him the language.
But the problem ...  He's attracting attention."
Hans laughed.
Karl's grin in return was feeble.  "Yes.  Of course.  How
could he not?  Even so, it's important for us not to be noticeable
in Berlin, which is why I brought him here, to get him off the
streets and give you a chance to look at him.
"He keeps his own counsel, that boy, and he's very good with
machinery.  Bright.  So I want you to take him to France with you.
You need a driver and he's a good one.  It's the best solution for
you both."
"Of course."
Karl nodded slowly, sipping his schnapps as he stared into the
fire.  "Thank you."
"For what?"
Karl just shook his head and they sat in silence.  It was a
very comfortable silence.

Two days later, Sergei was ushered into the library.  He just
stood there, looking slowly from Karl to Hans and back again.
"Sit down, please, Sergei," Karl said with unusual gentleness.
Sergei sat on the very edge of the sofa, forearms on his
thighs, hands hanging down between his legs.  His eyes were on
Karl.
"You have met my nephew, Colonel Richter."
"Yes."  He gave Hans a pleasant nod.
"I would like you to go to France with him, as his driver."
Karl said in his heavily accented English.
Sergei looked surprised.  "Do you really want me to do this?"
he asked Karl in the same language.
"Yes. It will be safer for you there."
"I think not," he said. "Not if there is an incursion."
"Invasion," Hans corrected quietly.
"Yes."  Sergei nodded.  "If there is an invasion.  I will not
fight.  I will never again fight."
"You will not be asked to fight," Hans said.
"Perhaps I would not be able to choose. But I would find a way
to surrender.  You must understand that."
"If you stay here," Karl said, "you might be faced with sur-
rendering to the Russians."
Sergei's face was very still.
They sat in silence.
"You do wish me to go," he said to Karl.
"It would be better for everyone, especially for you."
"And you are willing to take me," he said to Hans.
"It would give me pleasure."
Sergei nodded slowly.  "Then I will be in France." He rose and
faced Hans, "I will serve you well, as I would serve the Gospodin.
Just so you understand that I will not fight."
"I understand that."
"Yes.  Thank you." He looked from one of them to the other.
"I will go now."
He went.
