# Chapter 6

Hans' office was in the small town hall next to the hotel.  It
had been the mayor's and so, though it wasn't really large enough,
it was a comfortable room with windows that overlooked the valley.
It was a peaceful scene, one that usually helped his thought pro-
cesses, but this afternoon he was waiting for his first official
staff meeting and he was restless.

He was anxious to see how well his staff officers were able to
work together.  He was also very concerned about the state of the
regiment.  According to the report left for him by his predecessor,
everything was as it should be, but he had found that report an
exercise in self congratulation that had nothing to do with
reality.  Things were even worse than he was told they would be.

Perhaps it was just as well that things were so bad. The work
was good for him.  There was very little time to brood.  He was
getting stronger and he looked better than he had since the preced-
ing fall.  A little extra weight helped as did a tan from several
days in an open car traveling the area his battalion covered as he
got to know the units and the men under his command.

He was pleased with the way Schmidt was working to get the
chaos in the office straightened out, but he knew it would be a
slow process.  The files were a mess.

Ulrich Wagner and Schuster were working just as hard, looking
into the existing situation in their own regiments and dividing up
the rest with Schmidt and the battalion intelligence officer, a
German aristocrat, Captain Erich von Feber, the one officer who had
been with the battalion when Hans had arrived whom he had kept on.
Hans had had his doubts about keeping even von Feber, but Ulrich
Wagner had vouched for him.  "He's a good man," Ulrich had said.
"Smart, capable. He was transferred from commanding a Panzer unit
to intelligence only because of that leg."  But Hans sensed he was
also angry because of that leg.  A permanently stiff knee not only
meant the end of an active command, but it also meant that von
Feber would never again compete for the German Olympic Equestrian
team as he had in 1936.  Horses were his first love, but armor ran
a strong second.  "As for his reputation for being difficult..."
Ulrich had shrugged.  "It's just that he has no patience with stu-
pidity." He laughed. "You and I both know there's enough stupidity
in the Wehrmacht to keep him in permanent difficulty." Then he
lifted his handless left forearm.  "He saved my life.  Saved the
whole platoon.  Disobeyed orders to do it which is why he didn't
get the promotion and the medal he deserved.  Keep him.  You won't
be sorry.  Especially because I know he's with us against Hitler,
and has been for a long time."

So von Feber had stayed.

In addition to getting to know his own command and coordinat-
ing the efforts of his officers, Hans was getting to know the divi-
sional command.  He found his commanding officer adequate, no bet-
ter than that, unfortunately, but certainly no worse.

Straighten out the mess, Karl had told him.  The divisional
commander, General Kruger, had said the same thing, but for very
different reasons.  "That battalion reflects badly on us all," he
had said.  What he really meant was that it reflected badly on him.
Hans could only wonder why he hadn't done something about it him-
self long ago.

There were voices in the outer office and he was pleased to
hear that they seemed to be in easy conversation.    He was even
more pleased when there was a spate of laughter.

Schmidt appeared in the doorway. "Sir, everyone is here."
"Good."  Hans leaned back in the chair.  "Bring them in."

Ulrich Wagner came in first.  He was lean, trim, 5'10", with
red hair and a pleasantly homely freckled face.  He greeted Hans
and sat down in a wooden arm chair.

Von Feber, an elegant, almost effete looking man with black
hair and eyes to match, simply nodded and took the other arm chair.
Schuster was short and stocky, with powerful shoulders and an
impressive thatch of curly blonde hair. He smiled, then haunched
himself onto a heavy table by the back wall.

Schuster shut the door, then half sat on the radiator under
the windows.

After a week of hard investigation, they had come to give Hans
a situation report on the battalion.

"What have you found?" he asked when they were all settled.

"That this unit, this far-flung outpost of the Third Reich
which stands poised on the rim of the continent, facing the Saxon
hoards - Anglo variety - is totally unable to defend anything,
including itself."   Ulrich rolled his eyes in exasperation.

"A large hole in the front line of the defense of Germany's
rear?" Hans laughed back at him.

"Exactly."  Ulrich said.

"The ass hole in that rear," von Feber said as he flipped a
sheaf of papers onto the desk.

Hans looked at the thickness of the pile with dismay.  "Really
that bad?"

"Worse," said Ulrich.  "This regiment is in terrible shape,
right down to simple physical conditioning."

"Suggestions?"

Ulrich's forefinger indicated Schuster, something that gave
Hans real satisfaction.  As different as the two of them were -
Ulrich Wagner the witty, urbane well-educated Berliner and Schuster
the laconic, pragmatic northern farm boy - they were going to man-
age with each other, perhaps do even better than that.

Schuster picked up the sheaf of papers from the desk and
referred to them and to each of the other three men as he went
along.  It soon became clear that they were all working well
together, each deferring to the strengths of the others and con-
tributing in his own way.  And Schuster seemed to enjoy taking
hold.  It was obvious that he was going to be the regimental offi-
cer Hans thought he would be.

"Just the beginnings of a program," Ulrich had said, but it
was far more than that.  They had accomplished a great deal in
eight days, not only outlining the problems they had discovered -
which were legion - but making excellent suggestions for dealing
with each of them:  training programs; replacements and equipment
needed; even a few personnel changes.  And they were all ready to
get on with it, even enthused about doing it.  "It's all going to
need your support," Schuster concluded, "and a whole stack of writ-
ten orders."

"You'll have both."  Their satisfaction was contagious.
Despite the magnitude of what had to be done, Hans found that he
felt better than he had for a long time.

"The main problem, as the four of you see it," Hans said after
they'd wound down, "is the state of readiness in general, both per-
sonnel and equipment."

"And the field repair unit in particular."  Von Feber said.
"A quarter of Wagner's tanks are over there and another quarter
should be, along with about a third of Schuster's. And at least
half of them are obsolete or so worn out that they might not be
worth the effort.  But no one can tell us whether or not they are
except that unit and they're not talking.  It's ridiculous.

"When I went over there, I ran into with a stone wall.  Their
paper work is in chaos, and, as I said, no one was talking.  The
captain in command is an idiot.  It's the sergeant-major who runs
the unit.  So we elected our own ex-sergeant-major"  - He gestured
toward Schmidt. - "to go over there and find out what's

really going on."   He laughed.  It was a happy sound.  "They
didn't stand a chance."

Hans was very pleased.  It was Schmidt's relationship to the
rest of them that had worried him the most.

Schmidt blushed.  He opened his mouth, then he shut it and
cleared his throat.  When he opened it again, a spate of words
tumbled out.  "There's no organization over there!  And the backlog
..."  He lifted his hands in exasperation. "Things take weeks that
should take days.  It's not the enlisted men. They're all right, or
they would be if the officers and NCOs in charge were anything but
worthless self-seeking bastards who are more interested in what has
to be the large-scale black market operation they're running than
they are in repairing anything for the Wehrmacht.  They use the
trucks they do repair to make their collections." And so it went, a
bit too long as it always was with Schmidt but the way he had
worked it out was remarkable.  If he'd missed anything, it wasn't
much.

Hans squeezed his eyes shut and massaged the bridge of his
nose between his thumb and forefinger as he considered what he'd
heard.   "It's beyond me how any commanding officer could let a
situation like this develop."

"Pay-offs."  Schmidt said. "The previous regimental commander
included.  It's the only way they could have gotten away with so
much for so long."

Hans nodded wearily.  "All this with an invasion force build-
ing up across the Channel."

"The problem is - if you consider it a problem, -"  Ulrich
said, "there's no fighting here. Most of the men including all of
us, have been rotated in from the eastern front.  It's a place to
rest and recuperate before going east again.  They're eating well
and getting plenty of sleep despite the bombing raids, and most of
the time it's in a bed.  In this war, being assigned to France is
like dying and going to heaven." He stirred restlessly in his
chair.  "And so they worry that if they get too fit, the powers-
that-be will pluck the regiment out of this Garden of Eden and ship
it east.  Who can blame them?"

They all avoided looking at each other.

"In ordinary circumstances they'd be right," Hans looked at
Ulrich hard, in warning.  Despite Ulrich's assurances, he wasn't
sure what von Feber knew about the plot, but he did know that
Schuster and Schmidt knew nothing about it and he intended to keep
it that way.  "But our particular assignment is to get this unit
ready so that if the invasion comes here, this part of the coast
will be properly defended.  Even when we're ready, we're to be left
here.

"So all we have to be concerned about is getting the battalion
in shape. To be sure we're making a good start, there will be full
battalion maneuvers in two weeks."  He smiled.  "That should stir
things up."

"Amen."  Ulrich Wagner grinned.

Schuster rolled his eyes.

"And the bottle-neck in field repair?"  asked Schmidt anx-
iously.

"Dealing with the field repair unit will be sheer pleasure,"
Hans said grimly as he picked up the phone.

Sergeant-major Klaus Kriebel leaned his wooden chair back
against the wall, rested one jack-booted heel on Captain Manfred
Nammacher's desk and hooked the other over the front rung of the
chair.  He was a large man, coarse-featured, powerfully built and,
at 36, beginning to run to fat because a beer bottle was semi-
permanently attached to his left hand.

"Well?" he asked as his commanding officer came through the
doorway.

"Sit up," Captain Nammacher snapped.

"Yes, sir," Sergeant-major Kriebel said sarcastically.  His
feet came down and the front legs of the chair hit the floor with a
thud.  "It was that sort of interview, was it?"

The captain took off his gloves and slapped them onto the sil-
ver tray which sat at the exact center of a small square inlaid-
wood table by the door, then hung his cap on one of two decorative
hooks set in the wall over it on either side of a narrow mirror
framed in curly maple.  The fact that Nammacher did not, for once,
check his  appearance in that mirror did much to confirm the ser-
geant-major's  suspicions.

Captain Nammacher spoke only after he sat down and squared
everything on the top of his desk with the corners. Even then he
did not look at the sergeant.  "There are to be full battalion
maneuvers in two weeks.  Every tank presently in for repairs is to
be finished within one week - sooner, if possible - and for every
one that isn't done by then, there is to be a written report
detailing why it hasn't been finished.  Furthermore, you are
required to make a list of any spare parts which are currently in
short supply, especially those likely to hold up necessary repairs,
and you are to give said list to Colonel Richter personally, at
1100 hours tomorrow."

Kriebel laughed in disbelief.  "You can't be serious!  What
does he think he can do with a list like that?  Berlin will use it
for toilet paper." He gave a derisive snort as he reached down for
the beer bottle that was sitting beside him on the floor.  When he
realized it was empty, he simply let it drop.  It rolled under the
desk.

"Pick that up."

The order was obeyed with the maximum insolence possible.

"And from now on, leave the beer outside."  Nammacher sniffed
the air disdainfully.  "It smells up the office.  And to answer
your question, though it wasn't the colonel who told me, Berlin
will not use it for toilet paper.  I happen to know that his uncle
is the Quartermaster General of the Wehrmacht, and the colonel's

new first battalion commander, Major Wagner..."

"The one-armed wonder," Kriebel said sourly.

Nammacher looked at him sharply.  "Major Wagner gave up a job
as one of that colonel general's aides to come here."

"More the fool he!"

"Shut up, Kriebel," Nammacher said in exasperation. "I've had
enough for one day."

"And it's not even noon." Then Kriebel gave a placatory wave
of the hand.  "What you're telling me is that between the two of
them, they can get just about anything we want."

"Yes."

"This new colonel is crazy if he thinks that." Kriebel said.
"Even with all the new spare parts in Germany, we can't get all
those tanks finished in a week.  More like three weeks and that's
only if we work at it full time."

"We can finish what's in now in one week, at least those that
are worth repairing,"  Nammacher said. "I know we can.  You know we
can.  But only if we work on tanks and nothing else, which is pre-
cisely what's going to happen."

"Are you forgetting the Paris run two days from now?"  Kriebel
asked angrily.  "All we need is two men and one truck, that is
after we've made tomorrow's pick-ups.  And I have the perfect truck
for that run.  It came in this morning.  Just the right size.  Bro-
ken axle.  It'll be ready to go by tomorrow night."

"No.  No pick-ups, no Paris, no nothing.  Just tanks."

"Richter's got you peeing in your pants.  That's crazy.  What
can he do? We have the Gestapo in our pocket.  And given what we
pay them, they're going to stay right there."

"That was true. No more.  There are two new Gestapo men in
town, Brigadier Leubner, who's in temporarily from Berlin, and a
Major Pfister who has already taken over here.  Our old friend is
out. I went over there after I saw Richter, to feel out the situa-
tion.  They told me they wouldn't help, that they couldn't possibly
interfere with the proper running of a Wehrmacht unit.  Not that
they don't want our largesse."  His face reddened slightly.  "They
do."

Kriebel leaned forward and pointed an accusing finger at Nam-
macher.  "You did get the passes.  We can't move anything without
passes."

"Yes, I have passes," said Nammacher.  "Those will continue.
At least for the time being."  He squared up a small stack of
papers that were already square.  "But he wants a quid quo pro.  He
said that undoubtedly we come up with a great deal of information
about a great many people in our travels and that the Gestapo would
find that information useful.  He went on to say that we would have
to find our own way around Colonel Richter.  He was very specific
about that.  But then he went back to the information we can find,
that it might be useful to us as well, if we used it properly."

"He wants information about Richter," Kriebel said in sur-
prise.  "Now why do you suppose he wants that?  And why does he
need it?  He should be able to get anything he wants from Richter's
file."

"What he wants may not be in Richter's file.  There's a great
deal that's not in your file for instance."

"Or yours," Kriebel said.

"Just find something."  Nammacher wiped his forehead with his
handkerchief.  "Because until you do, we're going to have to run
this unit the way the colonel wants it run, without anything on the
side.  The black market operation was possible only because Colonel
Pflamm turned a blind eye.  But Richter ... " There was a vigorous
negative shake of his head.  "He's not going to put up with it."
"If he finds out about it."

"He's the sort of man who is going to find out everything, and
before too long, and when he does he's going to do something about
it."

"Just what could he do if he did find out?"

"Ship us east before any of your precious Paris connections
knew what happened to us.  Colonel Richter made it abundantly

clear that my command was a disgrace and that if you and I
don't do something about it at once, we'll be gone and he'll find
someone who both can and will.  The rumors were right.  He was sent
here to straighten things out and that's exactly what he intends to
do."

"More's the pity."

"So you will forget about Paris," Nammacher said with an impe-
riousness Kriebel had never heard before, "and concentrate on fix-
ing the tanks and every other vehicle we have in here and within
the week.  And when that's done, they're going to send in more and
we'll have another week to deal with those."

"I knew that Captain Schmidt was going to be trouble," Kriebel
fumed. "I checked on him after he was here.  He was the sergeant-
major for Richter's unit in Russia.  Won the Iron Cross First Class

before he made lieutenant."  He stared at nothing, his face
was grim.  "But he doesn't have eyes in the back of his head.  Even
without making collections tomorrow, there is enough for another
run to Paris.  That means two men for 24 hours.  No lay over in
Paris for them this time.  Too bad, but we all have to make our war
time sacrifices."

He rose.  "You want tanks done?  They'll be done.  And I'll be
glad to order every part there is, especially anything that will
sell."  His smile was nasty.  "If he really does have a pipeline to
Berlin, we might as well tap into it ourselves."

Nammacher was leaning forward with a look of anguish on his
face.

"Meantime, I will look around.  I have a few connections of my
own.  They may not be as exalted as the colonel's, but they can be
just as useful.  If I use them to look deep enough, what I find out
just might give us the leverage we need, both with the colonel and
the Gestapo.

One of Kriebel's most useful connections was a Frenchman named
Guy Ardiet who owned what was probably the most elegant cafe in
Caen.  He had worked hard to make it that way.  He also worked hard
to make himself look as if he owned such a place.  For the most
part, he succeeded.  He was 5'6" tall and elegantly slim.  Even in
these austere times, his clothes were tailored for him from superb
fabrics, and his shoes were custom made from the finest of leath-
ers.  Unfortunately he could do nothing about his face. He had
close set black eyes, a broken beak of a nose, a jutting chin and a
long scar down his left cheek all of which made him look like a
thug on the Marseilles waterfront. He added to this effect by
sweeping his black hair straight back and keeping it there with a
heavy, scentless hair oil.

He was sitting at a table in the bar with his account books
spread open on the table in front of him, sipping a glass of wine
when he heard the door open and the sound of a heavy man coming
across the floor.

The bent wood chairs were still upside down on the tables,
obstructing his view, but whoever it was, he was not happy about
the interruption.  Not only did he need to get the books done, but
Gaston had just finished mopping the floor and footprints meant
that he would probably have to do at least some of it again.

When he saw who it was, he was even more annoyed.  "Kriebel,"
he said evenly.

"Monsieur Ardiet," Kriebel replied sarcastically as he took a
chair down from the next table.  He swung it around with the back
toward Guy and straddled it.  "How about some calvados.  And don't
put it in one of those pissy-assed little glasses."

Guy rose slowly, went behind the bar and took down a brandy
snifter which he filled half full.  He held it up in inquiry.

"That will do," Kriebel said, "for a start."

"What's so bad that you need a drink this size at 9:30 in the
morning?" he asked in his heavily accented German as he handed
Kriebel the snifter.

Kriebel took a long swallow then wiped his mouth with the back
of his hand.  "A new commanding officer, Colonel Johann Richter.  I
want you to look into him for me."

"Why should I do that?"

"Because, fool, he means as much to your income as he does to
mine and it looks as if he's going to interfere with us."

"And you want to know something that will keep him from inter-
fering."

"Don't you?"

"No as much as you do," Guy said.  "If he closes down your
part of the operation, you are closed down.  I'm French.  I could
find someone else."

"With access to enough trucks and gasoline?  And passes.
Don't forget the passes."  Kriebel tried to laugh.

Guy lifted a placating hand.  He had a very good sense of when
enough was enough with Kriebel.  "You're right, of course.  I'll
see what I can do."

As Kriebel left through the front door, Guy heard someone come
in the side door.  He let out a hiss of exasperation.  "Who is it?"

There was no reply.

He got up, then sat down again at the sight of the woman who
was walking toward him.  "Madeleine," he said with all the impas-
sivity he could manage. It had been a long time since he'd seen
her, four years at least, but all she'd done was improve. She was a
little fuller across the hips but it became her.  And those breasts
spoke to a man.  He thought, and not for the first time, that it
was too bad she was his cousin.  "Guy," she replied soberly.

"Mother said you'd be coming in."

"Yes," she said absently as she looked around.

"What do you think of the place?"

"It must be just what you've always wanted it to be. But I
wonder how you managed to do it, given the occupation."

"As always, direct and to the point."  He reached over and
turned Kriebel's chair around for her.

People used to say that it was too bad Guy and Madeleine
hadn't become a dance team.   They moved well, both separately and
together, and were almost exactly the same height.  But neither of
them had the necessary communal temperament, so they'd never even
tried.

"Sit down, Madeleine." Then he raised his voice.  "Gaston!
Bring some coffee for your sister and me."

A boy's face appeared the swinging door to the kitchen.

"Coffee, Gaston," he repeated.  "For two."  The boy grinned at
his sister, gave a little wave and disappeared.

Madeleine stared after him in surprise.   "You're a miracle
worker!  Whenever I ask him to do something, all I get is a sullen
grunt."

"He likes what he does for me."

"And what does he do for you?"

"Certainly not what you could do for me."

"What do you have in mind?"

"You want a job?  Waiting table, perhaps?"  He was laughing at
her.  "No.  You couldn't do that.  Only men do that.  And the
kitchen is well staffed.  I thought you were a singer."  She was

one of the best chanteuses in Paris and he could only wonder
why she was back in Caen looking for a job.

"I am a singer," she said quietly.  "And you have every reason
to know just how good I am."

"Yes." There was anger in his voice.  "I do know how good you
are.  You got your start here, and you were filling the club, more
than filling the club, by the time you left.  You do remember leav-
ing here, don't you Madeleine?"

"Yes, I remember."

He nodded.  "You and I were both having a very profitable time
until you simply got up and walked out one day, and with a big pri-
vate party coming in that night, mainly to see you.  I had to get
Chantel." He grimaced. "They weren't happy.  What assurance do I
have that you wouldn't do that again?"

"Because I'm sick of Paris. I won't go back.  Not as long as
the Germans are there."

"There are Germans here."

"There are Germans everywhere." Her head came up and there was

a flash of anger.

He liked that. It was better than world-weariness by far.
"Just not as many of them here?"

"Certainly not as many colonels and generals.  Her voice was
tight.  "And I'd be working where I have a cousin to protect me."

Guy had always protected her when she was a child.  The whole

family had, because Madeleine had become a motherless orphan
at a very young age.  And he would give her a job now.  Not because
both his mother and her father would have his head if he didn't -
and they would - but because she was so good.  She'd make him a
fortune, provided she didn't insist he give her too much of it.  In
that, she surprised him. Her demands were high, but only moderately
so.  He would have paid her more, if he'd had to.

The coffee came and went and for once, Gaston didn't ask any
questions.

As they drank it, he wondered again what had brought her back
from Paris.  Between her singing and the way she attracted men,
Paris should have been the perfect place for her.  With all that
smoky black hair, a pout to her lower lip and that remarkable fig-
ure, men had always found her irresistible.  He wondered how old
she was and settled on 24, then decided that that was just the
right age.  There was just enough mileage to make her interesting
but not enough to make her shop worn.  He decided all over again
that she would be a gold mine just as she must have been to the
bistro owner in Paris where she had been thinking.  He heard the
Germans were coming in in droves.  Suddenly his head came up and he
was smiling.

"What do you want, Guy," she asked cautiously.  "You never
look at me like that unless you want something."

He laughed. He'd forgotten how bright and perceptive she was.
"There is something you can do for me.  Since you got so used to
dealing with those colonels and generals in Paris, you can culti-
vate a colonel, a new man who's stationed near here.  He interests
me."

"No."

"I just want you to get to know him."

"You just want me to get to know him," she repeated back at
him. There was a slight curl to the upper lip that made her even
more desirable.

"I want you to get to know him," he said again with a patience
he was far from feeling.  "To get to know all about him."

"To bed him?"  It was only half a question.

He shrugged. It was what he wanted of course, but he knew bet-
ter than to say so.

She shook her head and started to rise.  "I'm not bedding any-
one.  Especially not a German."

He reached over and his hand tightened around her wrist.
"It's your choice about the bed.  I meant what I said, all I want
you to do is to get to know him.  A few drinks..."

"Is that a condition of employment?"

He gave a slow negative shake of the head.

"Good," she said.  "I'll take the job but not the German. Now
let go of me."

His face hardened as did the hand around her wrist, but then
he released her abruptly.

"Don't want to bruise the merchandise?"

"Not the slightest mark."   He told himself that she would
come around, that he'd see to it.  But with his mother and her
father breathing down the back of his neck, he'd have to be care-
ful.  "When can you start?"

"In a few days, if the piano player's good enough."

"Charles du Bois."  He was watching her closely.

"He's very good."

He heard the sadness in her voice.

"Since it's Charles..." She sighed.  "Two days?  We won't need
much rehearsal. It will be as if we never stopped."

"Just the singing part of it, I trust," he said warily.  "He
is still married, no thanks to you.  So tread carefully, please.
His wife won't be happy to hear you're back and he's far too good
to lose."

She shook her head. "I want no man in my life, especially
Charles.  There was a time ...  But I've done him too much harm to
want to do him any more."

There was a commotion in the kitchen and Gaston's head
appeared.  "There's a delivery."

Guy nodded then looked back at Madeleine as he rose.  "I have
to go."

"Fine."

"Call Charles about rehearsal.  The store downstairs still
takes calls for him so the number's the same."
