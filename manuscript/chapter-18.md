Hans had come out of the cellar into chaos.  They hooked the
chair and swung it in, took the woman from him and helped him to
stand.  Only then was he able to look around and see how relatively
fortunate they had been.
The whole north side of the square was burning. Sparks and
burning fragments exploding out of the heat, fading into charred
bits of paper and wood that fell like snow, blackening everything.
Some people were gathered in clots around others who lay on
the cobblestones.  Still others looked around vacant-eyed as ambu
lances came, filled themselves with those on the cobblestones and
went.  Georg Brandt was talking to the stretcher bearers as they
lifted the woman into the ambulance.  When that was done, he turned
away to tend to someone else.
Schmidt and Schuster were working steadily, helped by five or
six men.  And there was another group working, digging more people
out of the ruins on the other side of the cafe.   He saw the Ges
tapo major go by on a stretcher.  There was a bandage over his eye.
One of the trench coated men from the bar was walking beside the
stretcher.  The other one was on the stretcher that followed.  He
was relieved to see Erich von Feber just standing there, looking
after them.
"Hans."  He turned and was surprised to see Madeleine climbing
down out of the ambulance the French woman had gone into.  A man
closed the doors behind her, banged the flat of his hand on the
side and the ambulance pulled away.
"Hans," she said again.
He waited for her.
"Are you all right?"
He nodded.  "And you?"
"Fine, but I must go and make arrangements." Madeleine was
talking quickly.  "Gaston says the house is fine.  The woman is
conscious." She gestured toward the disappearing ambulance.  "I
told her that if she needs help, she can say she's my distant
cousin.  I have cousins everywhere.  And tell Peter that when he
walkes back to the hotel, if no one is waiting in the lobby, he
is to go to his room.  Someone will come for him and call him
by name.  Just Peter.  They will say they have come from me.  He is
to go with them."
"I'll tell him," he said stiffly.  "And if there's anything I
can do, anything he needs, anything you need, just let me know."
"It's too dangerous for you to do anything.  I can manage.
Just come to me tomorrow, if you can."  Her eyes widened.  "Before
the colonel general comes."   She turned and walked away.
He watched her go, hating life, the world, the war, even her.
It was then that Peter was lifted out of the hole.

Madeleine closed the back door of her house carefully, then
moved to the gate to check the alley.  Though it was still the
black of night, she could see as if day were dawning.  Filmy pieces
of blackened debris were still floating down, collapsing into fine
powder under her feet.
She opened the gate and, when she still saw no one, ran to
Aunt Clothilde's back gate and slipped through.
"Who's there?"  The voice came out of the shadows.
"Madeleine, Gaston.  I told you I would come.  I need to see
Guy."
"You and everyone else in town," Gaston said as he stepped
into the light.
She tried to brush by him but he stepped in front of her.
"You can't go in."
"Yes, I can."
"He's busy.  Told me not to let anyone in, even you."
"After I see him, he'll be even busier."
A gruff voice came from the doorway.  "Need help, Gaston?"
"It's just Madeleine."
Henri, Guy's maitre d' appeared, nodded to her, then called
something incomprehensible over his shoulder and went to the back
gate.  He took a quick look, then slipped out into the alley with
out a word.  Two other men were careful to keep their faces averted
as they went out through the gate.
"I'll ask if he can see you now," Gaston said.
But Madeleine was having none of that.  She pushed past him
and went on into the house, through the tiny mud room, the kitchen,
and the small dining room, into the sitting room.  Guy was sitting
in the oversized velvet arm chair that had been her dead uncle's
favorite, his head back against the heavy lace antimacassar, his
eyes closed.  She had never seen him look this way.  His face was
gray and deeply lined.  His clothes were disheveled and soot
smudged and blood had soaked through the dirty bandage around the
palm of his right hand.
"Guy," she said, "it's Madeleine."
"Go away," he said without opening his eyes.
She looked around and saw Gaston's face peering at her around
the kitchen doorway.  "Go back on guard, Gaston."
Gaston didn't move.
"Go on, Gaston," she said.
"Do as your sister says," Guy said wearily.
After she heard the back door close, she asked if anyone else
was in the house.
"Just Aunt Clothilde.  She's in her bedroom and I hope she's
asleep."  He still hadn't moved.  "This had better be important."
She sat on the footstool in front of him and told him about
Peter and Sylvie.  "I want to put him in the secret room behind the
cistern in my attic, but I'll need help.  He's a big man and he's
concussed and has broken some ribs along with his collar bone."
Guy's eyes opened in slow motion and he just looked at her.
She could her the ticking of the ormolu clock on the mantel, smell
the stale cigarette smoke, see with great clarity a small line of
scabs on Guy's forehead.
"Say that again," he said.
She said it all again.
"I saw them," Guy said.  "I wondered about her but not about
him.  He's good.  The uniform is good.  So is the German.  I never
suspected.  If the English sent him, he's bound to have good papers
and enough money."  Then he sat forward and looked at her intently.
"Why are you doing this?"
"Does it matter why?"  Both the level and pitch of her voice
had risen.   "Probably because there was no one else to do it and
she trusted me.  She's staying at the Aldon and so is he.  He needs
to get out of there because the people working days will see how
badly he's injured and insist on sending him to the hospital.  Your
Uncle Albert is the night porter.  He should be able to help us get
him and everything that is his out of there tonight.  Will you help
me?"
"Can he walk?"
"He says so.  If he can't get back to the hotel, we can't help
him because they'll take him to the hospital and that will be that.
But I need someone with me.  The stairs to the attic are so steep.
If he fell..."  She shrugged.
"Only Gaston is here, Guy said. "I may need him.  Henri is
keeping an eye on things at the cafe.  Amazingly enough the wine
cellar is intact and we don't want anyone getting in there.  But he
does have men with him.  He'll have to spare you one.  Alois would
be best.  But only if you really need him.  Once you have this
American in the attic, he'll need a doctor. I'll send Claude over
tomorrow to see how soon he can be moved.  The sooner he's out of
town, the better.  He came here from somewhere, he needs to go back
there. It was imbecilic of them to send him without telling me.  If
I had known, we would have been ready to deal with this."  Guy
looked beyond her to the clock.  It was almost two o'clock in the
morning.  "I don't suppose she told you why he was here."
"No. She didn't."
"We need to know."
"She may not know and he may not tell you."
"I can't have other operations going on here without knowing
what they are.  It's too dangerous."
She shrugged.
"All right.  All right," he said.  "Get out of here.  If any
one stops you, you're worried about your colonel ..."
"I can manage that part of it, Guy," she said.
He waved her off with an exasperated hand.  "Go on," he said,
then leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes again.
She left without a sound.


Peter was on his feet.  His face was white, his jaw was set
and he was just managing not to sway.  "Pain pills in your pocket,"
said Georg.  "No more than two every four hours, but I'd rather you
not take them at all until morning.  Because of the concussion.
You're sure about this?"
"I have to be."  Peter looked at Hans.  "I'll give the book to
Madeleine."
Hans nodded.
Peter nodded back.
"All right," said Georg, loudly enough to be heard by anyone
who might be interested.  "But if you change your mind, have the
hotel call in a doctor."
"I'll be all right," said Peter and started off.  He concen
trated on moving toward the hotel without moving his head.  The
pain in it was profound.  He lowered his eyes only enough and just
often enough to make sure there was nothing to trip over.
Walking was easier than he thought it would be until he got to
the steps.  Fortunately they were broad enough so that it was logi
cal to take them one step at a time instead of step over step. Even
so, each step was an effort that made him dizzy.
A small erect elderly man in a bellman's uniform came out of
the front door and stood there gazing out into the square, watching
the proceedings with interest.  "Peter?" he asked as Peter
approached him.  He was still looking at the fire.
"Sir?" Peter said as if he hadn't quite understood.
"Lieutenant Pietr Jaeger," the man said quietly.  "If you will
walk straight past the elevator and turn left, into the back hall,
Madeleine is waiting for you."
"Come with me, please," said Peter.
"Only as far as the lobby," the man said firmly.  "Once I take
you through the black out curtains, you must do the rest yourself.
Cross the lobby, pass the elevator and turn left.  These days, one
never knows who is watching.  I have your room key and will see to
your things."
"I will need the mystery novel on the bedside table and the
packet wrapped in newspaper that is taped under the armoire."
"I shall manage."
"There is money in the packet.  Please keep enough to pay
Marie Flambard's hotel bill."
"I'll see to it.  Now move on or someone will wonder why
you're standing out here talking to the bell man."
Peter did as he was told.  There was no one in the lobby, not
even the night clerk who should have been behind the desk.  "Good,"
was Madeleine's only greeting when he got to the back hall.  A
stocky man standing behind her carrying came around and draped a
blanket over Peter's shoulder's without saying a word.
"To hide your uniform," Madeleine said.  "Your things will be
brought to me."


As he watched Peter walk carefully away, Hans heard a voice
behind him, saying quietly, "Colonel Richter."   He turned.  It
was Erich von Feber.
"I'm very glad you got out all right, sir.  I was worried."
"And I about you.  How did it go with the Gestapo?"
"Fine, except the major has a serious eye injury.  They're
taking him to the hospital.  But something odd happened that I need
to ask you about."  He hesitated. "Did you hear someone crying out
in English while you were in the cellar?"
"No."
"It happened twice. Only Fritz Heiligmann and I heard it the
first time. We both know some English.  The second time Major Pfis
ter heard it as well and it really set him off.  It seemed to come
from along the front wall but there was no way to be sure.  When I
saw you brought out of the front, I thought if you had been uncon
scious and were coming to ..."  He shrugged.   "It might have been
you."
"What did the voice say?"
"Something like, 'What's happening?'   Then later asking some
one to stop something."
Hans crossed his arms over his chest and hunched his shoulders
against the chill wind that was fanning the flames away from him.
"There was so much noise and a great many people were yelling and
moaning."
"Then I wonder who it was."  Von Feber looked toward the Ges
tapo man in a filthy tattered raincoat who was walking slowly
across the front of what had been the cafe, looking carefully at
first one person and then the next.  "They're going to investigate.
I thought you should know."


Peter stood at the bottom of the steep narrow staircase that
led to Madeleine's attic and wondered how he was going to get up
even the first step.  He had managed the walk from the hotel well
enough, but by the time he was half way up the steps to the second
floor, it was getting difficult.  His feet felt heavier each time
he had to lift one to the next step and the increasing intensity of
the pounding in his head made concentrating all but impossible.  He
knew that the stocky man was right behind him, but he doubted that
he could help him if he fell.  This was something he was going to
have to do himself and on these stairs, there was no banister to
help him.
He leaned forward and into the wall on the left, using it for
support as he reached out for whatever step he could get hold of
with his left hand.  It was the sixth.  He put up his right foot on
the first step and, putting as much weight as he could on his left
shoulder and hand, straightened his right leg and brought his left
up to join it.  Then he repeated the process.  His right arm swung
slightly in the sling as he moved and the pain was almost beyond
bearing.  Finally his hand found no more steps.  He was leaning on
floor.  He put his left foot up, then as he was lifting his right,
he slipped and fell forward.   His right forearm hit the edge of
the top step, separating the fractured ends of collar bone which
Georg had so carefully worked into opposition.  Agony stabbed
through his brain and he collapsed into oblivion with only the top
half of his body in the attic.

The stocky man stood there, a few steps below, looking at the
back of Peter's lower half.  "My God."  He sighed and turned back
to Madeleine.  "What are we going to do now?"
"Move him," she said.  "What else is there to do?"
"How?  He's too big for me to move him by myself, - even with
you helping - at least while he's unconscious.  Perhaps, if we
could haul him by his armpits, but you say that's impossible."
"Go get Gaston," said Madeleine. "He's at Aunt Clothilde's.
And get anyone else who's there, even Guy.  I'll get the mattress
out.  If we can roll him onto the mattress ..."
He was gone before Madeleine could finish.


Peter woke to pain, blackness and a confusion that led to ter
ror.  He reached out the one hand he seemed able to move and
touched something.  His hand recoiled.  It was a person.  "Who is
it?" he said fearfully in English.
There was a sharp intake of breath.  "Talk French," a woman
said. Her voice was thick with sleep.  "It's Madeleine.  You're in
my attic."
"I'm sorry," Peter said in his excellent French as awareness
came rushing back.  "I didn't mean to startle you."
"How are you?"  she asked.
"Thirsty."
"And hungry?"
"Yes."  He heard the rasp of a match being struck.  The sudden
flare of light made him squint.  When the candle settled into a
steady glow, she stood carefully because the space was small and
the slope of the roof steep.  She adjusted a heavy robe around her
self.  "Are you in pain?" she asked.
"If I don't move it's all right."
"Your head or your ribs?"
"Both."  He paused. "I want to sit up."
She looked at him soberly.  "You are not to move.  You
shouldn't even sleep.  I was to keep you awake, but you were uncon
scious.  I'm grateful you're awake now.  We were very worried."
"I remember.  I fell on the stairs.  How did you get me in
here?"
"I had help."
"How many people know?"  There was a knot of fear in his stom
ach.
"Including the man at the hotel, there are five people
involved, all people who are anxious to help you."
"Resistance?"
"It's dangerous to put a name to them.  They are simply people
who are willing and able to help you."
"What about ... Hans."
"He isn't involved," she said angrily.  "And I intend to see
that it stays that way.  You're far too dangerous to him."
"He needs to have the book."
"I have it," she said.  "He will come in the morning.  I'll
give it to him then."
"The rest of my things?"
"Your duffle bag is standing in the corner. Your papers and
money are in it.  As you requested, we took enough for the woman's
hotel bill, through today.  She will be told that the money has
been put with her things in her room so she can pay the bill her
self.  That way there's less connection to you."
"How is she?"
"I don't know, but I should later this morning.  I will tell
you then."
He nodded slowly, then sighed. "There are certain needs..."
She handed him an empty jar.
"You shouldn't have to deal with this."
Her laughter was genuine.  "When there is a need, of course I
should have to.  We should all have to, for each other.  And there
is a bedpan, for the other.  And I shall bring hot water to shave
you, along with breakfast which will have to be cold except for the
coffee."
"Why are you doing this?"
"I do this" - she sounded angry - "because you are a man who
is hurt and in trouble.  And because your cousin loves you and I
love him."
With that she was gone.  Peter wished he had never asked.
