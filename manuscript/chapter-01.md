# Chapter 1

*                             Late January, 1943*


Colonel General Karl von der Greif stood half way down the
length of Adolf Hitler's vast Chancellery office, looking out a
tall narrow window onto the square below, deliberately distancing
himself from the small groups gathering behind him.  Eyes flickered
in his direction from time to time, for he was an imposing figure
as he stood at parade rest, outlined against the window, but he
remained alone because there were few men willing to interrupt that
solitude.
At 54, the Colonel General was still powerfully built, with a
thick neck and broad sloping shoulders. Today his usually unruly
iron gray hair was contained, showing clearly both the breadth and
flatness of the back of his head, a shape that proclaimed the
slavic heritage he had in common with so many East Prussians.  His
face matched the rest of him, broad high cheeks, a crooked nose, a
generous mouth and wide set blue eyes that looked out from under a
slightly overhanging brow.
He was Quartermaster General of the Wehrmacht and a member of
the General Staff, which was reason enough for him to be in Hit-
ler's office any day, but on this day there was a far more compel-
ling reason.  His wife's nephew, Major Hans Richter, was to be
named Hero of Stalingrad and given the Swords and Oak Leaves to his
Knight's Cross by the hand of the Fuehrer himself.  Ordinarily a
man would feel gratification at seeing someone who was like a son
recognized for outstanding valor by the head of state, but the Col-
onel General was feeling far from gratified. As much as he loathed
Adolf Hitler and wanted him dead, he loved Hans Richter and wanted
him alive.  In a few minutes, the Fuehrer would arrive and Hans
Richter would walk in to face him with a bomb strapped under the
heavy bandage on his leg. If all went as planned, Hans Richter
would blow himself and the Fuehrer and anyone else within range,
into oblivion.  "Just be sure you stand well back," Hans had said
again as they had left the house that morning.  The Colonel General
had said he would try.  "Don't try, do it."  But Karl von der Greif
knew that it might not be possible, just as it hadn't been possible
to refuse the Fuehrer's invitation to the ceremony.
None of this showed.  Anyone watching him saw only a formid-
able looking man who was lost in thought.
"Herr General."
Karl von der Greif stood absolutely still, collecting himself
before he turned and put his back to the window.  "Herr Reichsfueh-
rer," he said in sober acknowledgement of the Gestapo chief.
"A proud day for you, is it not," Heinrich Himmler said.  "To
have your nephew honored by the Fuehrer himself."
"I am very proud of him."
"Yes. Yes." Himmler's eyes darted here and there.  "As well
you should be." He paused.  "I heard of your flight into poor
beleaguered Stalingrad to bring him out."
Karl had a sudden memory of Hans lying on a stretcher in the
ruins of a frigid hangar, wrapped in a ragged great coat that was
far too big for him, his eyes empty, staring, his wasted claw of a
hand plucking at the only button left on the coat.  "I went into
Stalingrad to see how the resupply situation might be improved," he
said evenly.  "When I found that Major Richter had been badly
injured and was ill ...  I was fortunate to be able to bring him
out in time."
"Surely you knew about him before you went in."  There was a
high pitched little laugh.  "After all you took a doctor in with
you, a major, a friend of Major Richter's, I believe.  Or was this
... medical major there to look into the supply situation as well."
His lip twitched as if it were trying to sneer.
"He looked into the medical supply situation.  It was appal-
ling."
"As any doctor, even a major, could see, I'm sure."  He
paused.  "Isn't this particular major Wolfe Brandt's son?  And
Wolfe Brandt was a good friend of yours, I believe."
"A friend from childhood."  It was a careful answer.
"An interesting man, Wolf Brandt.  One would have thought that
anyone so articulate and intelligent could have seen what the Fueh-
rer would do for the Fatherland, would have joined joyfully in sup-
porting him instead of opposing him so strongly."
"He paid a high price for that opposition."
"Yes."  Himmler's lips tightened into what might have been a
smile.  "Two years in a camp.  Still, it did not seem to benefit
him.  One would have thought he would have used the time to reflect
on the error of his ways." He paused.  "He died last year, I
believe, while still under house arrest. You went to see him, did
you not, just before he died?"
"The day before.  He asked to see me."   There had been many
visits, but the colonel general didn't mention those.  And no evi-
dence of his surprise at the extent of Himmler's knowledge of such
old news showed in his face.
He was aware that time was getting short.  It was almost 20
minutes since he had watched General Jodl take Hans off to one of
the smaller reception rooms down the hall.  It would take no more
than ten minutes for Hans to get briefed on the ceremony.  Another
five for him to go into the men's room to activate the chemical
detonator which had been carefully set into the plastic explosive
under the bandage around his thigh.  Then 20 minutes for the acid
to eat through the wire that tripped the hammer that would set off
the explosive.  They had to be at least 5 minutes into that.
There was a stir.  The small crowd moved toward the center of
the room as Hans came through the doorway, flanked to the right by
General Jodl, Army chief of staff and to the left by General Zeitz-
ler, chief of operations for the joint chiefs.  It gave Karl a pang
to see him looking so frail.  Hans was not a big man, 5'8" at the
most, and after Stalingrad, he was also pale, pathetically thin,
and limping slightly.  He had a broad jaw and a generous mouth that
had, before Russia, smiled easily.  But now his face was set,
expressionless, his eyes a dull black and sunk deep in their sock-
ets.
We who are about to die, Karl thought, salute you.  Tears came
to his eyes and he involuntarily stiffened to attention.  They all
stiffened because, though Karl had no idea where Adolf Hitler had
come from, he was suddenly in the room, walking toward Hans.
"This way, Herr Colonel." Karl felt the Reichsfuehrer's hand
on his elbow.  It was an effort not to jerk away. "You need to be
in the forefront, where you can both see and be seen."
He let himself be urged past the massive conference table and
through the semicircle that was forming until he was in the very
front and just to one side, by the window, where he could see
everything that happened.  His only consolation was that Himmler
was right beside him and that they would be blown out through the
long window together, their brains splattering all over the square
below along with the Fuehrer's.  There was a burst of anger at the
thought that he and Hans would have to die in such company.
But then fear rose up and threatened to overwhelm him.  He
struggled with it and the effort made him light-headed.  He swayed
a bit, caught himself and separated his feet to stand again at par-
ade rest.  The swaying stopped.
Karl saw everything and everyone with absolute clarity.  Hans,
his face pale and solemn, still flanked by Generals Jodl and Zeitz-
ler, the weak but handsome face of General Keitel, the chief of the
general staff, Reichsmarshal Goering right behind the Fuehrer,
looking even more like the gas bag he was because of the pale blue
uniform he affected and, hovering nearby, the sly-looking monkey-
like figure of Josef Goebbels.  But most important of all was the
stooped, pasty-faced old man who was now Adolf Hitler.  Karl
thought, and not for the first time, that it was beyond belief that
this was the man he had once seen as Germany's savior, the man who
had inspired a whole nation to Armageddon.
He clasped his hands together tightly behind his back to hide
their shaking as he saw Hans' eyes flicker toward him.  There was a
warning flash of anger that faded at once because the Fuehrer had
started to speak.
"Colonel Richter," that too familiar gruff voice said as flash
bulbs popped and left blue blobs floating in front of his eyes.
He saw Hans stiffen, heard his questioning, "My Fuehrer?" Then Hit-
ler's words sank in.  Hans wasn't a Colonel.  He wasn't even a
Lieutenant Colonel.  He was a Major.
"Gentlemen, we have succeeded," Adolf Hitler said gleefully.
"Our little announcement has come as a complete surprise."  The
Fuehrer's glazed blue eyes were suddenly clear, even twinkling as
he smiled.  Then he laughed.  There were polite little laughs in
reply and one hearty guffaw which could only have come from the
depths of Goering's massive belly.  Karl cleared his throat.  His
mouth was dry.
"Thank you, my Fuehrer." Hans gave a stiff little bow.
"No thanks are necessary, Herr Colonel," Adolf Hitler said in
kindly tones.  "This promotion is richly deserved."  He turned
toward
a man who was standing stiffly to one side holding a black
velvet pillow with a heavily embroidered German eagle at the cen-
ter.  The man put the pillow forward slightly and Hitler lifted the
watered silk ribbon lying across it.  He held it up and the silver
decoration hanging from it swayed slightly as he turned back to
Hans Richter.
The pounding of Karl's heart echoed through his head and his
feet inched backwards.
"Colonel Richter, we give you the Swords and Oak Leaves to
your Knight's Cross, in recognition of your outstanding service to
the Fatherland.  With a total disregard for your own safety, you
led a group of men into the Barricady tractor factory and retook a
large section of that factory from the enemy" - the Fuehrer's voice
had turned angry. -  "and in so doing, saved the lives of 37 sol-
diers of the Reich who were trapped there.  "But" - he raised a
hand to silence any applause that might have come - "we also give
this to you as the representative of all of our valiant fighting
men in Stalingrad, those who have died as well as those who live
and fight on for the Fatherland.  In honoring you, we honor all of
them."
He stopped.
Karl waited.
Nothing happened.
He saw Hans bend from the waist, saw the individual hairs on
the back of his neck, the faint tremor of his hands, the bulge of
the heavy bandage vaguely outlined under the uniform riding
breeches he was wearing.
Adolf Hitler put the ribbon over Hans' head.
Still there was nothing.
Then Hans stood and stayed very still while the Fuehrer made a
small adjustment to the ribbon.  When that was done, he patted
Hans' arm almost absently and stood back to admire his handiwork.
There was a vast emptiness in Karl's chest and it was diffi-
cult for him to breathe.  The only sound was a smattering of
applause that
became briefly enthusiastic.
Karl head swirled with incoherent thoughts and his knees shook
so hard that he had to lock them to be sure of staying on his feet.
He waited, standing well back as he had promised while Hans shook
hands and posed for what should be the last pictures of his life.
Hans' face was ashen and beads of sweat were beginning to form
on his forehead.
Goering said something to Karl.  Though he had no idea what it
was, he managed a small smile and a nod in reply.  Satisfied, the
Reichsmarschal turned away.
Then uniformed waiters filed in, enlisted men, with trays of
white wine and apple juice.  He grabbed a glass of wine and would
have drunk it down if only to hide the shaking of his hands except
for the sudden raising of glasses.  There was a toast to Hans by
the Fuehrer.
Hans replied, toasting first the Fuehrer and then the men of
Stalingrad.  That made the group restive and the hypocrisy of that
made Karl angry. Stalingrad was what this ceremony was supposed to
be about.  But obviously none of them wanted to face the death of
the Sixth Army, a senseless death that most of them were respon-
sible for, especially Goering, who had insisted that the Luftwaffe
could supply an entire army that was cut off well behind enemy
lines.  He had told Adolf Hitler just what he wanted to hear, given
him the excuse to order them to stand fast when they still could
have broken out.  But it wasn't just Goering.  All these men told
Adolf Hitler only what he wanted to hear because they were so
afraid of the decrepit madman they called their Fuehrer.
The level of his anger rose along with his fear, fear that he
would die and that Adolf Hitler and his toadying asses would not.
It had to have been twenty minutes.  More like thirty or forty, but
still there was nothing.
Then the Fuehrer vanished as mysteriously as he had come and
General Zeitzler took Hans' elbow and ushered him toward the door.
Karl followed. He could see Hans was moving with difficulty.  His
pallor had deepened and his limp was more pronounced.  He staggered
slightly as they walked through the outer office where all the sec-
retaries were standing at attention.  He looked neither left nor
right and Karl looked only at him.
Hans was barely through the doorway into the hall when his
knees gave way and he seemed to fold down onto himself.
Karl rushed forward to catch him but the heavy wool of the
uniform jacket slid off the end of his fingers.  There was a
muffled thud as Hans landed heavily on his knee.  Then he toppled
to his left, onto his healing left thigh, onto the plastique in the
bandage covering the still open wound and onto the detonator that
was stuck into the plastique.
Karl couldn't seem to move as he waited for the explosion. It
didn't come.
His thoughts arrived in a simultaneous jumble.  Had Hans made
a mistake when he activated the detonator?  If so, had the fall
activated it?  If it had, they had only twenty minutes.
He heard, as if from a great distance, General Zeitzler com-
plaining to General Jodl.  "I told you it was too soon.  He isn't
well."
Karl found himself kneeling beside Hans searching for a pulse.
"You wanted to wait until Stalingrad fell?"  asked General
Zeitzler angrily. "If we had, this ceremony would have been sense-
less."
Karl looked up and into the face of the sergeant of Adolf Hit-
ler's praetorian guard.  "Get a stretcher, and tell someone to have
my driver bring up the car."  He went back to searching for a
pulse. "Hans!  Wake up!"  It was as despairing cry.
There was no reply.
They can't be allowed to take him to the hospital, Karl
thought frantically.  They'd find the explosives.  Now there were
18 minutes at the most.  "I will take care of him, General Jodl."
Even though he was still on his knees, it was Karl at his cold com-
manding best. "It was too much for him.  He needs to get home, into
bed.  He will see his own doctor there."
There was no argument.  The two generals just stood there
waiting, fidgeting. "We must not let the Fuehrer see this," General
Jodl said to Karl in a stage whisper that could be heard at the
other end of the hall.  "It would be very upsetting to him."
There was the thudding of running feet and two thick set cor-
porals arrived with a stretcher.  Karl busied himself with getting
Hans onto it.  "Be careful with that leg," he insisted. "It was a
bad wound and he fell onto it.  May have reopened it.  Let me."  He
supported Hans' left leg himself, sliding it carefully onto the
stretcher.
He glanced at his watch.  There were 15 minutes left.      The
corporals picked up the stretcher in cautious unison and carried it
down the long hallway, down the broad staircase and out to the car
with Karl on one side and the sergeant of the Guard on the other.
Otto, Karl's aged chauffeur/valet was waiting with the rear
passenger door open and a blanket in hand against the chill of the
day.  "Be careful of his leg," Karl insisted again as they were
putting him in.  There were 11 minutes at the most.  It took all
Karl's strength not thrust them aside and to put Hans in himself.
It seemed to be taking far too long because, as Karl had insisted,
they were handling
Hans' with care, treating his leg as if it were very fragile
indeed.  Finally he was propped up into the back driver's side cor-
ner, covered by his great coat which had been rushed from the cloak
room by yet another corporal.  His left thigh was supported by the
seat, his booted foot by Otto's blanket which had been folded into
a tight roll and placed on the hump in the middle of the floor.
The sergeant of the guard was holding the door to the front passen-
ger side open but Karl shook his head and indicated the back door.
One of the corporals leapt to open it for him.  "Thank you," Karl
said as he slid in to the cramped space left beside Hans in the
back.
"We were glad to be be of help, sir."  The corporal said
through the still open doorway.  "I hope he'll be all right."
"He will be.  He just needs rest.  We'll see he gets it.
Thank you again."  He pulled the door shut himself.  The corporal
got his hand out of the way just in time.
"Go, Otto."  He glanced at his watch.  "The bomb didn't go
off, but he may have activated it when he fell.  If so, we have
less than 7 minutes."
Otto didn't say a word.  He let the car glide out of the court
yard before he put the accelerator to the floor.
"By way of the park," Karl snapped as he fumbled for his
pocket knife.  "Then stop the car and get out.  Leave me to tend to
this."
"That may not be possible, sir."  The car slowed.
Karl looked up and saw with horror that they were at the end
of an army convoy that was moving in stately progression.  "Can't
we get around them?" The knife was open in his hand.
"Not for two more blocks, sir.  I would suggest that you get
out and let me drive on with him. I am 80 years old."  There was
the barest quaver in his voice.
"You and Hans blow up in a car and I'm not in it?"  He shook
his head vigorously.  "They'd know."   He lifted the the heavy wool
of the breeches, thrust the blade of his pocket knife into it and
began sawing at it frantically.
He had no illusions.  If the car blew up and he survived, he
would be questioned, tortured, and the officer's plot to kill Hit-
ler would be exposed.  Besides, he knew he couldn't leave Hans
lying helpless in the back seat of the car to die alone.  It would
be far better to die with him, but it galled him to think that they
would be dying for nothing.
The knife slipped.  He drew in a jagged breath and started
again, lengthening the slit.
The car swerved sharply and he lifted the knife with a curse.
"We are going around the convoy, sir."  Otto cleared his
throat.
Karl put three fingers from each hand into the slit back to
back and tore the cloth apart, exposing the bandage.  There was no
detonator in sight.  He tore again, all the way to the side seam
and there it was.  It had been thrust under the top of the bandage,
deep into the plastique along the side of his leg.  Only the tip
was visible.
His hands were shaking so hard that as he reached for it, his
fingers slipped.  He had to start again.
"What happened?"
Weak as it was, the sound of Hans voice startled his so much
that Karl wasted a precious second to look up.   "Not sure," he
said gruffly, and bent back to his task.  "And if you don't hold
still, we may never be sure."  He had the head of the detonator
firmly between his fingers.  "The fall may have set it off." He was
sweating and praying as he began to pull it out.  "... have less
than a minute."
It was out, free.  He was rolling down the window frantically.
"Don't, Karl."  Hans' voice was weary but it stopped Karl mid-
turn.
Hans face was expressionless, his eyes fixed well beyond Karl.
"There are children out there."
Karl glanced out the window - There were two, with two nannies
pushing baby carriages disappearing into the background.  - then
down at the detonator in his hand.  He could barely see it.  Sweat
was dripping into his eyes.  "And if I did throw it out ..." His
voice cracked.  "If I did, the explosion would give us away."
"Better to die by our own hand."
Karl barely heard him and what he heard didn't register.  The
chemical had eaten through the wire.  The hammer had fallen.  When?
Just now?  Or was that the problem? He was frozen in place, death
in shaking hands, watching.  Nothing happened.  He couldn't speak,
couldn't move, couldn't even look away.
"Twenty-five minutes," Otto's voice was a high squeak.
"We are to live then." Hans sounded profoundly disinterested.
"Perhaps."   Karl was sitting utterly still.  "The hammer
tripped but the detonator didn't go off."
"Defective." Hans sighed.
"I know.  I know," said Karl angrily.  At that moment he hated
the detonator, hated the failure, hated the world.  He wanted to
break things, to break the car window beside him and throw it out.
The very sight of it made him sick.  But he didn't dare.  Something
might still set it off and besides, even if it didn't blow, it
would be found, would be evidence to someone of something.  It was
a British detonator and the plastique was British plastique.  He
damned the British for not getting it right, damned the British and
the French for being so stupid in l936 and not stopping Adolf Hit-
ler while they still could.  He damned the German army for doing
what it was told to do all too well, damned everything, including
himself for being such a fool and supporting Hitler in his madness
for so long.
They were silent.  Otto's hands held the steering wheel in an
iron grip, his eyes ranging quickly from one side of the road to
the other, watching, alert for anyone or anything in his way.  Hans
leaned into the corner and closed his eyes.  Karl sat staring out
the window, unaware of where they were, the detonator held level in
his right hand, his mind a deliberate blank.  He had too much expe-
rience with explosives to trust that it was truly defective and not
just a hang fire.  But he was past fear and into lethargy.
"I am about to turn into the driveway, sir."
"Leave the car in the middle of the gravel at the back," Karl
said, taking the obvious precautions though he was increasingly
sure they weren't necessary.  "Then go into the house and telephone
Major Brandt.  After that, come back out and help Major ... Colonel
Richter into the house.  I shall tend to this."
The tires crunched over gravel as the car glided to a stop in
the middle of the large parking area in the back, well away from
both the house and the garage.
"Open the door for me."
There was no response, just the opening of the driver's door,
a rustling and then the gentle click of the door being carefully
shut.  Karl heard the crunch of boots on gravel and then his door
was opened slowly, cautiously.
"I will do as you say, sir."
Karl grunted briefly in response.  His hand closed firmly
around the detonator as he turned in the seat and swung his legs
out.  He used the other hand to heave himself out of the car as
Otto backed away then turned and hurried to the house.
Hans had not said a word.
Karl stood, looking for somewhere safe to put it.  Bare ground
was too hard in January for digging, and even if it weren't, any
digging at this time of year would be far too obvious for far too
long.  The snow would have to do.  He strode across the gravel,
onto the lawn, then stepped carefully from bare patch to bare patch
until he was standing well away from the house and the garage, in
front of a bush where the snow had been caught and piled deep.  He
hunkered down and pushed in the detonator, slowly, carefully,
finally pushing only with his forefinger until it was well and
truly in.  Then he swept at the snow to cover the opening, but the
snow had crusted and no matter what he did, he could see the marks
his hand had made.  He was far from satisfied but it would have to
do, at least for now.
He stood, brushing the melting snow from his hand, his eyes
still hard on the spot.  It was the death of a dream of death.  But
then he was diffused with a fierce joy that brought tears to his
eyes.  Despite everything they had both survived.  Hans was alive.
He turned and went back to the car.  Otto had not come back and
Hans had not moved.  Hans said nothing, did not even object when
Karl helped him into the house, half carrying him up the stairs and
into the bedroom that had been his since he had been released from
the hospital the week before.
Karl lowered him to the bed and pulled off his boots. Then, at
the sound of the door bell, left him, fully clothed, lying on top
of the douve.  The material of the torn left leg of his breeches
hung loose, exposing the white bandage that was slowly staining
red.

Later, after Georg Brandt had redressed the wound and given
Hans a sedative, he and Karl sat in the chill of the wood-paneled
library in somber silence, drinks in hand.
"How is he?" Karl said finally.
Georg shook his head.
Karl looked at him in alarm.  "A relapse?"
"Probably." Georg sighed and shifted in his chair. "He's still
weak and what he did was a terrible strain.  But if he had suc-
ceeded, none of that would have mattered, would it." He gave a bit-
ter little laugh.
There was a long silence.
"He didn't speak," Georg said finally.  "Didn't move.  Just
lay there and let me do anything I wanted."
"Is he in pain?"
"Probably.  The wound had reopened at one end.  But he didn't
react, even when I gave him a mild sedative.  He just took it.
Oddly enough that worried me more than anything else.  He hates
sedatives.  Says they make him too fuzzy to think."
"Maybe he doesn't want to think," Karl said gloomily.
"He wants to die."
Karl just stared at him.
"He does." Georg sounded sad.  "I've seen it in other men who
have seen to much of living in this war."  He looked down at his
drink.  "I never though I would see it in him."
"Then we have to find something for him to do."
"If he'll do it."  Georg took a long drink.  "I've never seen
him like this."
"Nonsense," Karl blustered.  "It's just the let down.  Give
him a good sleep, time to recover.  The promise of a decent com-
mand, one that suits his talents."  His voice trailed off.  He
cleared his throat.  "He'll be fine."
Georg drank the rest of his drink.  "I hope so." He rose.  "I
have to get back tot he hospital."
"Something out of town.  It's safer,"  Karl said into empty
space.  He was still in his chair. "If I can find some reasonable
place to send him," - He looked up at Georg anxiously. "would you
go with him?"
"If this war makes that possible.  It would be sheer pleasure.
I'm sick to death of Berlin, especially since Birgid and the chil-
dren left for Bavaria."  Georg gave Karl a small smile.  "He is
alive you know.  Given that anything is possible."
"Yes, he is."   Karl's eyes were full of pain.  "Thank God.
But I do have to ask myself how often we can fail without getting
caught."
"As often as it takes," said Georg grimly.
