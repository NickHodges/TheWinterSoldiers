# Chapter 20
leaning against the water tank with a pillow behind him, recover-
ing.   A worn suitcase was beside him containing what could be
kept from his duffle bag, but the duffle bag itself was gone.
A woman named Babette had taken it with her when she completed
her ministrations which included a bath, a shave, a painful change
of clothes - He was now dressed in the worn clothes of a French
farm laborer who was both shorter and wider than he was. - and a
change of hair color.  He was now a dirty blonde.  The difference
in his appearance was remarkable.
A photographer had also come, to take his picture. Then he had
gone, taking the Alsatian papers with him so his picture could be
replaced and the description altered.
Peter was alone and, for the moment, it was a relief.  He was
tired of people talking at him, touching him, tinkering with him,
organizing every phase of his life.  He knew there was no choice,
that they were all doing the best they could for him, but he still
didn't like it.
He was tired, wanted to sleep but couldn't because of the dull
pain in his shoulder, an all-consuming ache in his head which made
it hard to think.  And beyond that, there was the fear.   That his
fears were entirely realistic only made them worse.  He was afraid
for himself, for Sylvie, for Hans and for all the people who were
helping him.
The doctor had also come and gone, checking the tape on his
ribs and revising the sling so that instead of going around his
neck, it went across both his chest and his back so that the
weight was carried by his opposite shoulder.  That way it both
immobilized his arm and supported his shoulder in a way that made
it easier for him to move.
But the doctor had also put an unnecessary bandage around his
head which covered much of the right side of his face.  There was
even someone else's blood on the pad that covered his right eye.
Peter had protested but the doctor had insisted.   "The blood
makes the bandage more realistic.  It also makes it less likely
that they'll take it off.  As for the bandage itself" - He
shrugged that expressive Gallic shrug. - "it makes you even harder
to identify.  It also makes you logical.  You are going to a
cousin in the country to recuperate after being injured in the
bombing raid.  You were working in the rail yards, remember that.
The rail yards.  Living in the boarding house near the station.
You had just gotten here the day before.  Repeat that please."
By the time Peter was done repeating it, the bandage was
securely in place.
He was Alsatian now.  Madeleine had had him review the papers
while he was eating, telling him, in a tight-lipped fashion that
he needed to refresh his memory before the photographer took them
away.  Then she had gone about sorting through the things in his
dufflebag in silence.  That silence, and everything else that had
happened subsequently, including the two old trunks that they had
stuffed into his hiding place before the panel was shut, told him
that he was going to be moved soon, undoubtedly before he could
see Hans, and there was nothing he could do about it.  His life
was out of his control.  He had to move at the behest of other
people whose only concern was to get him safely out of town and
back to England.  He argued with himself, telling himself that
that should be his only concern right now.  He had given Hans the
letter and the book.  What did it matter, he asked himself over
and over, if he didn't see Hans?  Alive and in Caen he was a dan-
ger, not only to the people who were helping him, but to Hans.  He
tried to tell himself that he really had done all he could, that
it was enough, but in his heart, he didn't believe that.
He looked down at his sling with disgust.  All his life, he
had been able to count on his physical strength and agility.  Now,
when it counted most, both had deserted him.
There was nothing he could do about any of it and that was
worst of all.
And so he forced himself to concentrate on better things, and
what came was the first time he had even gone duck hunting with
his father.
He shifted position slightly, but was concentrating so hard
that he didn't realize that he was marginally more comfortable.
He was twelve.  The sun was just rising and he was out in his
father's duck boat.  The mist was rising off the reeds and there
was the bitter after taste of the coffee his father had insisted
he drink to keep warm.  He was asleep before the ducks arrived.

Guy was pleased with the change in the American's appearance
but that was all he was pleased about.  Francois hadn't yet
returned with the truck.  Gerard, the photographer, hadn't brought
back the revised papers and it was getting too late in the after-
noon for comfort.
Just before noon, Henri had brought word of Kriebel's arrest
and Guy had sent Francois out on a legitimate delivery to see if
the passes Kriebel had gotten for them fromm the Gestapo were
still valid.  Francois was at least an hour overdue, which told
Guy that not only were the passes not being honored, but the
searches at the road blocks were thorough.
The passes would have simplified everything, letting the
American through the road blocks with only a minimum of interest.
With his greatly changed appeareance and new papers - Gerard was a
master with papers. -  Guy felt there was still a reasonable
chance of getting him through, especially because he handled him-
self so well.   He had no chancce at all if he were left at Made-
leine's.
He simply had to get Peter out of town.  If he could get him
out tonight, there was even the possibility that he could get not
only out of town, but out of the country.  The one thing he hadn't
told Madeleine was that a Lysander was coming in, bringing two
agents, money and more explosives, but all it was taking out was
intelligence.  That meant they'd have room for the American.
Ordinarily Guy did not go to landings, but he decided that if
he could get the American out of Caen, he'd go to this one.
He knew that if Francois didn't get back in time with the
truck, that he could always get Claude deVries to take him out.
A doctor was one of the few men with a pass that let him go any-
where and the fuel to get there.  Claude could always be taking an
injured patient out into the country, to a 'cousin' to recuperate,
on the way to making a house call. - That was even more logical
than taking him out in the truck. - But even that would depend on
Peter's Alsatian papers getting to him in time.
He checked his watch.  It was 4:30 PM.   The Germans were due
to arrive some time after five.  He cursed that.  It made every-
thing far too complicated, and too rushed.  It meant they had to
get the American out of that house right now.
He rose.
The only safe place to keep him in the meantime was Claude's
surgery, but he would have to walk two blocks through alleys to
get there.
When he came through the kitchen, Aunt Clothilde looked up
from her mending.  "You are worried."
"As always, Auntie," he said easily.  "It's worry that keeps
me alive."
As he stepped out the back door, everything seemed to happen
at once.  Gaston literally ran into him and Francois pulled up at
the back gate in his truck.
Gaston lifted the papers in triumph.  "They're perfect," he
said with pride, as if he'd done them himself.
Guy waved at Francois, then took a moment to look at the
papers.  Gaston was right.  Gerard had even managed to match the
ink the British had used and the new page looked just as worn as
the others.
He put the papers in his pocket and turned to Francois who was
leaning against the gate.  Francois looked exhausted.
"What happened?" Guy asked.
"Back ups at the road blocks going out.  They're checking
everything.  They took the truck apart.  The passes don't mean
anything.  No road blocks for incoming traffic, but they're moving
troops in so the roads are jammed with SS troops.  If he's ready
to leave, we'd better go."
"He better be ready," said Guy.  "Come on, Gaston." He ges-
tured to the boy.  "Youre going to stand watch at the front door."


Erich von Feber put down the telephone and looked over at
Schuster.  His face was grim.  "Schmidt said that the colonel and
the colonel geneneral are already on their way into Caen.  I don't
like it."
"You don't think they'll turn back when they see the SS going
into Caen in strength?"
Von Feber dialed the Aldon's number.  "This is Major Erich von
Feber," he said when the connection was made. "I understand that
Colonel Richter has a dinner reservation.  ...  Yes.  6PM.  ...
The reservation still stands?   ...  No, no.  That's fine.  I just
wanted to make sure.  Thank you."
He hung up. "They're going to be there.  You know how punc-
tilious he is about cancelling reservations he's not going to
use."
"Yes.  I do know," Schuster said.  "I also know that Hans said
he wanted things to appear as normal as possible.  If we go in
there with a motorcycle escort ...  For God's sake, he's never had
a motorcycle escort."
"He's also never had a colonel general here before.  I have a
bad feeling about this.  If we go in and there's no need for us,
blame it all on me.  But if we didn't go in and something happened
..."
Schuster waved that off.  "There's no way to blame it on you."
He smiled.  "I outrank you.  And you're right.  If something did
happen ...  The two of us in my staff car and 6 motorcycle outrid-
ers ...  To the Aldon." They rose as one.


Peter was sitting at the head of the attic stairs with his
feet on the third step down.  The suitcase was in the hall below,
along the wall, with the peasant's jacket folded over it.
"Are you ready?" Guy asked him.
"Yes."
Madeleine appeared in her bedroom door and Alois came out of
the kitchen.
"We're ready," said Alois.
"Come down," he said to Peter.  "We can't help you.  The steps
are too narrow."
Using his good arm, Peter lowered himself one step, then put
his feet down one step and lowered himself again.  Though he moved
slowly, Guy saw that he also moved steadily, with only one brief
stop, half way down.  But when he finally stopped with his feet on
the hall floor, despite the chill, there was a slight sheen of
sweat on his face and his jaw was working.
"Well done," Guy said quietly.  "There are still the steps
to the ground floor but they're wider and there's a bannister.
We'll be able to help you.  Then out the back.  There's a truck
waiting."
He didn't finish because Gaston's voice came urgently up the
stairs.  "The German staff car is coming.  Madeleine's colonel."
"He's early," Guy said in accusation.
"So he is," Madeleine snapped.  "But there's nothing either of
us can do about that.  Put him in my dressing room.  He'll be safe
there until I can get rid of them."
"Be quick," Guy said. "They could be here any time."
Peter struggled to his feet.  "Where is this damn dressing
room."
Madeleine indicated her bedroom door then picked up the suit-
case.
"Take Gaston out the back, Alois," said Guy.  "And tell Fran-
cois to park the car in the street.  I'll let them in."


Hans and Karl would have been even earlier if they hadn't been
held up by the troops being brought into Caen.
"Is there still time to see him, even if he is there?"  Karl
asked as the staff car worked its way through the streets.
"If he's there, I'll see him," said Hans.  "You wait in in the
car.  It will be faster that way and safer."
And so it was Hans alone who climbed the three front steps and
rang the bell.  The wait seemed interminable.
Finally the door was opened by a disheveled Guy Ardiet.  "I'm
sorry to have kept you waiting." He stood back and gestured for
Hans to enter.  "I've been fixing Madeleine's kitchen sink."
Then he called up the stairs.  "Madeleine, are you presentable?"
There was a sound in reply that they both took for an assent.
Guy indicated the stair case.  "If you will excuse me..." He
lifted inquiring eyebrows.
"Of course," Hans said and stood watching Guy go off down the
hall, thinking that Guy should have thought of a better reason for
looking as he did.  His hands dusty, not dirty, or at least not
dirty enough.  It was Guy who was helping Madeleine with Peter.
Hans wondered why he wasn't surprised, especially given Guy's
association with Kriebel in the black market.
"Hans?"
He looked up and saw Madeleine leaning over the railing.
"Coming."  He took the steps two at a time.
"You can't stay," she said.  "The SS is coming.  They're going
to search the town" - She lowered her voice. - "And we have to get
Peter away, so please ..."
"I saw the troop trucks as we were coming into town,"  Hans
said.  "But since he is here, I need to see him."
"There isn't time.  We can't get him out while you're here."
"Three minutes.  Where is he?"
Peter's appearance was a shock.  "What happened to your eye?"
"Nothing.  It's part of my disguise."
"Damn effective.  Listen, I have to tell you ...   Wait."
Hans heard a commotion in the hall.  He shut the door and turned
to lean against it.
"Hans."  It was Karl. Sergei was standing behind him.  "The
SS is coming down the street.  They must have decided to search
this sector first."
"Please," Madeleine said. "You have to go."
"It's too late for that," Karl said.  "We would be seen leav-
ing.  Besides, if there is nothing here to be found, there is no
danger to anyone in our being here.  If there is something to be
found ... Perhaps having a general staff officer will keep them
from searching too closely."
She looked at Hans in appeal.
"It's all right," he said to her.  Then he opened the door the
dressing room.
There was first surprised recognition, then stillness in
Peter's face when he saw Karl.
"You are Peter Harris?" Karl asked doubtfully.
Peter's eyes flickered to Hans, then back to Karl.  "Yes,
sir."
Karl lifted out the small straight chair that stood in front
of the dressing table to give him more room.  "You don't look like
yourself.  It's just as well since the SS is searching the town,
looking for you.  They'll be here soon.  We'll going to stay right
here to make sure you're not disturbed.  After they go, we'll have
a talk."
"Fine, sir."
"Sergei," Karl said, "get in there with him.  Help him get
more comfortable, if you can." He took off his belt, pulled off
the holster and unsnapped the cover.  "You know how to use a
Luger?"
"Yes," said Sergei. "My father had one.  But I will not
fight."
"It's not for fighting," said Karl.
"I see." Sergei reached out his hand and took the gun and its
holster.
"Hurry," said Madeleine.  "There's no time."  She urged Sergei
into the tiny room and shut the door.  "We have to get out of our
clothes."


Sergei put the holster in the back corner farthest from the
door behind the suitcase.  Then he settled himself on the floor
with his back against the end of the dressing table and pulled the
Luger's slide back, then forward to put a bullet into the chamber.


Karl looked at Madeleine in consternation.  "Get out of our
clothes?"
"Yes. Please."   She was very pale.  "Take off your clothes.
If we are in bed, the three of us ..."
"They might not think to search the room," Karl finished the
thought for her as he started to undo his jacket buttons.  He took
it off and draped it over the back of the straight chair he had
taken out of the dressing room.   Then he arranged his trousers
over it with care, to make sure that the red stripe which showed
him to be a general staff officer was clearly visible.
"Hans," he said, "remind me to tell you what a remarkable
woman this is."
"More than I deserve," Hans said.  He had hung his uniform
jacket over one side of the back of the overstuffed chair. Now his
trousers went over the back.
Someone was pounding on the front door.


Peter heard the pounding.  Suddenly he was cold and he started
to shake.  Though morphine could dull pain, it was nothing against
terror.  He felt the Russian readjust his position and reached out
a hand only to encounter knee.
"I will take care of you," the Russian said quietly.
"And yourself."
"Of course."


"Who will let them in?" Hans asked.  The last of his clothes
were gone.
"The door's not locked," said Karl grimly as he pulled off his
shorts and leapt, naked, for the bed.  "They'll let themselves in.
The radio." He pointed.  "Full volume."
Music blared into the room.  Madeleine turned her back and
first her robe, then her gown fell to the floor.  She turned to
get into the bed with Karl's eyes full on her.  Despite every-
thing, he had the beginnings of an erection.
The radio was so loud that they could barely hear the boots on
the stairs.
"I shall grab you, my dear, carefully, and I think it would be
best if you had vital hold of our boy here."  Karl ordered.
Karl's arms came around her from the back, his hands carefully
avoiding personal invasion.  They were all three closely entwined
when the door burst open.
A tall, lean, muscular SS sergeant was in the doorway.  He
stood, rifle at the ready, knees bent, weight slightly forward on
the balls of his feet, pale blue eyes moving warily around the
room.
It was Karl who moved first.  He broke away, grabbed the duvet
they had thrown from the bed and put it over Madeleine's head,
covering her completely.
"Who the hell are you?"  Karl asked.
"SS."  The man said, stating the obvious.  "We're to search
every house."
"The radio, my dear," Karl said with exaggerated politeness as
Madeleine's head reappeared.  Then he leaned over, grabbed his
undershorts and sat down to put them on.  Hans did the same.
She wrapped the duvet around herself and rose. The din disap-
peared in an instant.
"What are you looking for?" Hans asked.
The sergeant's eyes took in the entire scene with a lazy arro-
gance.  "A man masquerading as a German officer," he said slowly.

Sergei flicked off the Luger's safety.

"And what does this man look like?" Hans asked.
"6'3" or 6'4", perhaps even taller, and 220 pounds, with black
curly hair."
"Anyone here look like that?" Karl asked.
"No, sir."
"Then get out."
"No, sir."  There was a slight curl to his lip.  He didn't
bother to come to attention.  "We are going to search the house.
My orders are most specific."
"Then search it," Karl snapped, "but be quick about it."
There were already disturbing sounds from downstairs.
"Stay just as you are," the sergeant said and turned his head
slightly. "Cover me, Pfeil.  I'm going to start right here."
A smaller man appeared in the doorway, rifle at the ready.

Sergei steadied his right elbow on his knee.  His finger was
inside the trigger guard.

The sergeant's eyes were hard on Madeleine.  She met his gaze
with an insolent directness. It was he who looked away.
"Why not try under the bed," Karl said.  He moved to the chair
and picked up his shirt.
"I told you to stay where you were," the sergeant said.
"I don't take orders from sergeants,"  Karl said.
The man's face reddened.
Hans picked up Madeleine's gown from the floor, handed it to
her, then gestured toward the screen that hid the sink in the cor-
ner.
She took it and disappeared behind the screen.
The sergeant still hadn't moved.
"I told you to be quick about it," Karl said.
The sergeant motioned to the man in the doorway without taking
his eyes from Karl.  "Search the room," he said.
"Try under the bed."  Karl stuffed one arm into a sleeve, then
the other.
The soldier looked toward the sergeant who waved an impatient
hand toward the bed.
He looked briefly, then straightened up with a shrug.
Karl moved.  He flung open the door to the tiny closet that
was packed with clothes and had a welter of shoes on the floor.
"Is he here?"
The soldier cleared his throat.  "No, sir."
"Madeleine," Karl said.
She came out from behind the screen with the silk robe
wrapped around her.
Karl folded up the screen.  "Is he here?"
The sergeant gestured for the soldier to move forward.  Reluc-
tantly he moved toward the door to the dressing room.
Before he could get there, Karl pulled the door half open,
careful to keep his body between the opening and the sergeant.
"Is he in here?" Then he slammed it.  "Or here?" He pushed the
soldier aside and heaved the upholstered chair half way across the
floor.  "He's not here either, is he.  So get out."
The sergeant's fingers twitched on his rifle and he drew in a
deep breath.  It was a minute before he let it out.  "Come on,
Pfeil."  He turned on his heel and left with the soldier trailing
behind.
Karl's eyes closed and he seemed to sag, enough so that Hans
moved toward him.
Karl waved him off, then jerked a thumb toward the door to the
hall.  Hans went to shut it.
"Tell them,"  Karl said, grabbed his trousers and sank into
the overstuffed chair to put them on.


Sergei heard soft knock on the dressing room door.
"It's me," said Hans Richter.
Sergei switched off the safety.
The door opened slightly.
Sergei looked in confusion at the colonel who was wearing only
his undershorts.
"They're still in the house so stay where you are until I tell
you it's safe."  With that the door closed and Peter and Sergei
were left in a darkness that was considerably less black.


"Are they all right?" Karl asked.  He was leaning back in the
chair, wearing only his trousers and his shirt, which he hadn't
bothered to button. There was a small water glass full of brandy
in his hand.  Madeleine was holding out another toward Hans.
Hans took it, took a long swallow, then put it on the bedside
table. His hands were shaking.
They all stayed motionless as the sound of jack boots seemed
to surround them, in the hall, in the attic, on the stairs.  Doors
opened and closed.  Something broke.  Something else landed with a
thud.  There was laughter, then a cough.
Finally there was an incomprehensible call.  The sounds faded.
Then, finally, the front door slammed and there was silence.
Hans let out a long sigh and reached for his pants.  Madeleine
began weeping in relief.
"Go, Hans," Karl whispered.  "Make sure they haven't left
someone in the house.
Hans nodded and sat down to put on his boots.
"And Madeleine, please sit down,"  Karl said.  "That is after
you get me some more brandy."  He lifted his empty glass.
Now it was only Hans' boots that they heard, starting in the
attic and working his way down.  Doors opened and closed. Then,
finally he came up the stairs.
"All clear," he said wearily and picked up his glass.
"Tell them."  Karl gestured toward the dressing room.
Hans opened the door.   Sergei and Peter looked up at him sob-
erly.
"They've gone," Hans said.
"For now," Sergei said as he rose.  "The question is, what do
we do with your cousin now?"
It was Karl who answered.  "There is nothing we can do with
him.  Only Madeleine can do anything."
She put the screen back up, then opened the closet.
"We have to follow her lead," Karl said.  "But meantime there
are some things Hans and I have to talk to Peter about, alone.  It
won't take long."  Then, to Sergei.  "Go downstairs.  Check the
staff car.  Then wait down there.  Just in case they come back."
As Hans finished getting into his clothes, Madeleine came out
from behind the screen.  She was wearing the slacks and a sweater
she had grabbed from the closet.
"Madeleine," Karl said, "if you would please go down to the
back.  Make sure the door is locked and that no one comes in that
way."
When they had gone, Hans helped Peter up and put him into the
straight chair.  "Brandy?"
Peter shook his head.
"All right then ..."  Karl cleared his throat.


The night was clear and the moon was was rising.
Guy leaned against his Aunt Clothilde's back fence listening
as German voices faded away down the alley.  Only when they were
gone altogether did he realize how fast his heart was beating.
He had gone around the corner, to see if the staff car was
still there.  It was but it was empty.  And just then the SS had
come out of the front of the house and had nearly caught him.  The
fact that they were empty handed registered only when he got back
to Aunt Clothilde's.
He was puzzled.  If the car was empty, that meant the general
was in the house as well.  He couldn't imagine why, if the general
stayed in the car when Richter went in, he wouldn't have just
stayed there when the SS came.
A vision was intruding.  It was Madeleine's face when she
heard that the colonel's car was coming down the street.  Guy knew
her well.  It was odd, an expression he had never seen before.
But the one thing he did know was that she wasn't afraid, at least
not in the way she should have been.
If the colonel found the American, it would be just as bad as
if the SS found him, wouldn't it?
The answer came full blown and with such appalling clarity
that he knew he had to be right.  She wasn't afraid because
Colonel Richter knew the American, knew the American was there.
It was the colonel that the American had come to see.  And London
hadn't told him - hadn't told Herve - that the American was coming
because they wanted to protect their German colonel.
It made sense of the Gestapo investigating Richter.  It made
sense of how the American had been able to get out of the cellar
without being unmasked.  It also made sense of Madeleine's sudden
about face, of why she was suddenly so involved in the war when
involvement had been the last thing she wanted.  She had to have
been the one to discover who the American was when they were in
the cellar and because she loved the colonel, she was protecting
them both.
There was just one piece he couldn't make fit and that was
why had the colonel had risked everything to get the American out
of the cellar when it would have been far safer to let him stay
there and die or even to have arranged that death from, say, a
crushing injury to the head.  But even though saving the American
made no sense to Guy, he was sure that that was what the colonel
had done.  He was also sure that if the colonel had saved the
American once, he would do it again.
Then he had another thought, and that one surprised him.
The general had not stayed in the car.  Even though the SS was
coming, and Richter had to at least suspect that the American was
in the house, he had not insisted that the general stay in the car
when the SS came.  That could only mean that the general knew
about the American as well and was using his rank with the SS to
try and protect both him and the colonel.
For the first time in days, Guy Ardiet smiled.  He had a large
problem.  He couldn't use the truck.  Francois had had to take it
back to the other side of town to the yard where it supposedly
belonged.  But now it was far too late to be making deliveries
anyway.  That meant Guy had no way to get the American out of town
tonight, before the SS could come back to Madeleine's house, prob-
ably in the morning.  But he did have a German colonel and a Ger-
man general with a staff car that had a very large trunk. Now all
he had to do was figure out how to get those self-same Germans to
solve his problem for him.


Sergei was still outside when Madeleine came down the stairs.
She was grateful for the moonlight that let her see her way, that
let her see that there had been no damage to the front door.
As she walked down the hall toward the back, it was another
relief to see that the SS had closed the two doors to the down-
stairs apartment. That way she didn't have to look at what might
the they might have done in there.
She was almost at the back of the house when a shadow crossed
the moon and spilled onto the floor through the window in the top
half of the door.  It was the shadow of a man.
She stopped.  Her mouth was dry and it was hard to breathe.
The man bent over slightly and a key scraped in the lock.  She
opened her mouth to cry out but nothing came.  The door opened and
the man slipped in.
As he turned to close the door quietly after himself, she saw
who it was.
"Guy," she whispered in relief, startling him into stillness.
Finally she heard a long exhale.
"My God, Madeleine, don't do that.  You scared me."  He was
whispering back.  "I came to make sure everything was all right."
"It is."  There was a faint rumble of voices from upstairs.
"But you have to go.  They're still upstairs.  I just came down to
make sure the back door was locked.  And Sergei is just out in the
front, checking the staff car."  Her heart was beating fast.  "I
don't want him to see you."  She tried to turn him around and push
him toward the door. "Go."
"Not yet."  He paused.  "I've figured it out, Madeleine."
"What have you figured out?"  she asked though there was a
cold sureness in her about what he would say.
"Your colonel knows the American.  He was the one the American
came to see."
She stood mute.
"I'm not going to betray him," Guy said.  "If the Allies took
the risk of sending someone to see your colonel, they had good
reasons and I will not betray either those reasons or him.  But if
any of us is to survive this American, your Germans are the ones
who are going to have to get him out of Caen and they're going to
have to do it tonight, in the trunk of their staff car."
"That's ridiculous."
"It's not.  If he can be gotten out of town tonight, I can
probably get him out of the country.  I can't move a truck at this
hour.  Claude could take him, but he'd have to have a legitimate
medical emergency.  And we certainly can't leave him here.  When
they don't find him, the SS will be back and they'll take this
house apart.  So what other answer is there?  You go with them.
Say you want to get out of town.  It's not a bad idea, you know.
You can go to Phillippe.  Show them the way to the old hay barn on
his farm.  I'll pick him up there.  If I can't, wait there with
him until morning.  Talk to Phillippe then.  He'll know what to
do.  Don't tell him anything except that you're helping me.  He
already has the woman, Sylvie.  She and the American can go back
to wherever they came from together, when they're well enough.
Madeleine just looked at him.
"Do it," Guy said.  "But leave me out of it.  Say it's your
idea, that you know a place where he'll be safe.  Also that you
want to get out of town because the Gestapo will send the SS back,
or maybe come themselves.  You know Major Pfister wants to talk to
you anyway and it has to be about the colonel, but he didn't have
time to give you an official summons.  Thank God.  I can always
deny I ever told you that.  Besides, he's in the hospital and
won't be out until next week some time.   Come back in two or
three days, sooner if I tell you because if the Gestapo does want
to see you, we don't want them going out there to look for you."
They both turned at the sound of the front door opening.
"The car is fine." Sergei called up the stairs in German.
"Do you want me to wait down here?"
"Check on Madeleine," Hans said. "She hasn't come up yet."
"I'll be right there," she said loudly enough for Sergei to
hear her.  Then to Guy, in an urgent whisper, "Go."
He opened the door.  "Do it.  I'll cover you, and them.  You
cover me."
With that he was outside, leaving her to lock the door behind
him.
