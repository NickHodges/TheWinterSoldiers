# Chapter 8
Peter Harris had his green hills.  Though no one had told
him, he knew from the terrain and the grey-gold stone of the
buildings that he was in the Cotswolds.  But despite the fact that
he was in the country, billeted in a small crofter's cottage on a
large estate, he hadn't had any time to enjoy it.  He had studied
codes and transmitting and receiving, was learning all about the
new plastic explosives and was just finishing a course in a very
advanced form of self defense and learning the three cover stories
that would go with his three sets of papers.   And he was talking
German.  He was even thinking in German again.
When he arrived from Africa, he thought he would be taken
straight to London.  Instead, a man whose name he was never given,
had conducted an intensive two hour interview at the air base
where he landed.  He was told that he would probably be in France
no longer than a month and that there were two parts to the
assignment.  First, he would be bringing supplies - explosives, a
new type of radio and codes, - all of which he would train the
Resistance to use.  The second would take only a few days, but it
was the part of the assignment for which he was peculiarly suited
and for which he would have to train the hardest.  He was to con-
tact a German officer.  "Why would this German officer be willing
to be contacted by me or anyone else?" he had asked.  "You won't
be told that until just before you leave," the man had replied.
"Just suffice it to say that we would not be asking you to contact
someone there was reason to believe would not be willing to talk
with you when you got there.  You have extensive knowledge of Ger-
many and Germans.  Your language is nearly perfect and we will
work hard to make it even better.  You speak French."
When he agreed to go, he was put in the back of a small
closed van and brought to this place.  Training had started the
next day.
Peter still wasn't sure why he had agreed to it.  He told
himself that it was because it was a chance to do something mean-
ingful.  But then, he had argued back at himself, every job in
this war was meaningful. And small.  No one job made that much
difference.  It was simply the sum of all the parts that would win
the war.  He was simply a small cog in a vast machine that would
grind on to victory with or without him.
He had gone on to "I'm going because I've been asked," with-
out much success. Most of it sounded like something almost anyone
with good French could do.  Indeed that anyone who was French
could do with considerably less risk.  But then, he reasoned, he
was being asked to do that part of it simply because he would be
there anyway.  He certainly hadn't been brought in from North
Africa to do that.  As the man had said, it was the other part,
the part for which he was "peculiarly well suited."  That was the
challenge, almost a dare.  "I dare you ..."  Words, that as a
child, he had rarely been able to resist.  He had broken a leg
climbing a tree on a dare when he was 8.  Been lucky not to break
the other when his cousin James had dared him to take a horse over
a stone wall in Prussia, the summer he was ten.  He hadn't even
thought about the horse.  Karl von der Greif had put the fear of
God into him about that.  Not railing or shouting, just standing
there saying with a quiet intensity that was far more frightening,
"Even if you won't be sensible for yourself, you have an obliga-
tion to take care of the horse."  The horse had fallen but fortu-
nately had nothing worse than a serious abrasion on his left rear
leg which had healed up nicely.  He had felt terrible about that.
At least this time, he reasoned, the only person he would have to
take care of was himself and, especially given the training the
British were giving him, he felt he ought to be able to do that.
Most of the time he was either too busy or too tired to think
about it. He had thought he was in good shape, but the physical
training he was undergoing was beyond anything he had ever known
and he usually fell into bed, exhausted.
On one such night, a month after he had arrived, there was a
crash and he bolted upright in bed, not sure whether he was awake
or asleep.
The black form of a man stood akimbo, almost filling the
doorway, backlit by the yellow glow from the light in the hall.
He disappeared almost as Peter saw him, merging into the shadows
in the room.  Before Peter's eyes could readjust enough to find
him, he was grabbed, hauled out of bed and thrown to the floor.
"Get up!" a voice grated at him in German.  "Up!"  But he
couldn't get up.  A foot was holding him down and a large shadow-
form loomed over him, full of menace.
"Up," the voice commanded again.  The foot was gone.  The man
moved until he was standing back far enough to make rushing him
problematic and now there were two men standing behind him.'
Peter rose slowly, tensed, ready to spring, but a quick blow
sent him back to the floor with a thud.
"Up."  The voice was quieter now, which only made it more
worrying.
He got up on all fours.
"Up," the voice insisted.  "Slowly.  No tricks."
He got to his feet, swaying, then exaggerated that sway so
that the other two men grabbed his arms as much to keep him from
falling as to hold on to him.  He jerked his arms forward and
struck out as he twisted free.  His fist connected with hard
muscle before he went down again.  A knee in his back pushed him
to the floor, making it hard to breathe.  Fingers twisted into his
hair and hauled his head back until his eyes streamed with tears.
"Tie him."
He was tied hand and foot, dragged out of the house, thrown
into a car and driven over bumpy back roads.  When the car finally
stopped, he was hauled out and dragged again, only dimly aware of
what was happening as they put him in a chair and tied him to it.
The questioning went on and on.  He lost all track of time
and got well past the point where it mattered whether this was
real or just part of his training.  It had taken on a reality of
its own.
He stank.  He had wet his pants when the effort needed to
hold it in and the pain involved took too much from his ability to
concentrate.  A light burned into his eyes.  His hands and feet
had lost all feeling, which was a mercy.  Each was tied to a
separate part of the chair which was too sturdy to break.  He had
tried, then tried again, but after that he had stopped.  It was
futile and far too painful.
Through it all there was the same voice, harsh and relent-
less, then soft, almost crooning before turning harsh again.  The
man was only a shadow behind that blinding light, except for an
occasional gleam of black leather belt and a peaked officer's cap.
SS?  Gestapo?  He couldn't be sure.  Finally he saw the silver
flash of SS lightening runes on his collar and caught a glimpse of
face.  It gave him no comfort.  The face was hard, tough, with
glittering eyes and a long scar running down the left cheek.
Almost as soon as he saw it, the face disappeared back into the
shadows.
"Name."
"Pietr Jaeger."  He said it over and over again until it was
his name.  "First lieutenant of Panzers.  Number 6844686."
"Nonsense."  Thwack.  "You are not Pietr Jaeger.  You are an
American working for British Intelligence."
The man switched from German to English, then back again,
back and forth, back and forth, trying to catch Peter out.  Peter
worked to keep thinking in German, telling himself over and over
that he was German,  Pietr Jaeger spoke English.  It was part of
his background, his education, his travel, but he knew he had to
stick to German.  It would be his only salvation.
Pietr Jaeger's father had owned a large clothing store on the
Meisterstrasse in Stettin, but both parents were now dead.  His
brother died in Stalingrad.  And so it went as he gave another
man's life story over and over.  It helped that he knew Stettim
and that whole section of Prussia really well, because of the
three summers he had spent there with James and John.  He knew it
even better now because of the names, the history and politics of
the area and the peculiar local customs the British had been
pounding into his head.
The questioning ended as abruptly as it began and he was left
there, head hanging in exhaustion, every joint in his body aching.
Eventually he heard the scraping of feet and a black hood
with no eye holes was hauled over his head.  Then they untied him
and his hands and feet became an agony of returning circulation.
They grabbed him under the arm pits and dragged him off, shoved
him into the back of a car which again bumped over the country-
side.  When it stopped, he was dragged out and into some sort of
building where he was dumped onto a hard wood floor.  He heard the
sound of jack boots in a hall way, going away from him. Then a
door slammed and it was quiet.
It was a long time before there was enough feeling in his
hands to let him work the hood off.  When he succeeded, he just
lay blinking, staring at the tiny pattern of flowers in the
wallpaper covering the walls of his assigned room in a small
crofter's cottage on an estate in the Cotswolds.
He started shaking uncontrollably.

The next morning a summons was served with his breakfast,
asking that he present himself at 0930 in the library of the manor
house that served as training headquarters.  The house was a won-
derfully chaotic pile of gold Cotswold stone, both Gothic and
something that might vaguely be called Victorian, that rambled
along the top of a low hill.
They had offered to send a car for him but he wanted to walk
to see if the exercise would ease out some of the aches.  It
helped but did nothing for his hands which were still swollen.
His fingers felt thick, as if they didn't quite belong to him.  He
flexed and extended them as he crunched up the gravel drive,
relishing the warm breeze on his face, the green of the ancient
trees and the different greens of the lawn and the hills beyond.
It cleared his brain of SS runes and physical agonies, the
terrors of Nazi occupied France and everything else, at least for
the moment.
But that moment was gone as a ruddy-cheeked sergeant-major
ushered him out of a wood paneled hall and into the sunny book-
lined library.  There were two men in that room.  Emlyn Rhys was
sitting behind the desk opposite the door.  Another man sat off to
one side, away from the french doors that led to the outside.  He
had one leg straight out in front of him and was looking at Peter
intently with pale blue eyes.  He recognized that face with a
shudder.  The SS runes were gone as was the peaked German offi-
cer's cap, replaced by British military fatigues.  But there was
the same impressive hawk's beak of a nose and the same long scar
running down his left cheek.  A sick feeling settled into the pit
of his stomach.
"How did I do?"  His eyes didn't leave the man's face.
"Exceptionally well, or so the other two men told me.  It was
my first time as well."  His English was heavily accented.
"You should make a business of it," Peter said drily.
"You're very good."
The eyes softened into sadness.  "I don't want to do it
again.  I didn't like it."
"Did you know you wouldn't before you started?"
"Yes."
"Then why do it?"
"That is not important."
"Yes," he said angrily.  "You're right.  It is also none of
my business.  So why am I here?"
"Your evaluation," Emlyn Rhys said.  "Suggestions that may
help save your life if that time ever comes.  Sit down and lis-
ten."
Peter sat.
The German's expression was sympathetic.  "Your German is
excellent.  Prussian German.  It surprised me."  His voice was
brisk, businesslike.  "You kept your story.  There were hesita-
tions, yes, but no mistakes.  You were being careful.  But you
must learn not to fight unless there is a chance of it doing you
some good.  Fighting makes these people angry, or worse it excites
them, gives them an excuse to beat you.  Not that they need
excuses.  They would probably do it anyway.  So no fighting unless
there is a real chance to get away, or unless you want to distract
them from a certain line of questioning.  But you cannot do that
very often or they will see the pattern and realize you are hiding
something, or, what is more dangerous, they may see that you have
had training.  If they suspect you've been trained, you will die,
very painfully, after telling them everything they want to know.
By that time, death would be a relief.  It is a fine line to
walk."
There was silence as he stared out through the open french
doors.  "And you should seem more afraid," he said.  "They expect
fear.  They like it.  Everyone is afraid.  They have a right to
be."  He sounded angry.  "Especially when they are taken in the
middle of the night, as you were.  It is the worst."  He shifted
in the chair and settled his left leg at a slightly different
angle, bending the knee only marginally.
Peter had the sense that the man was in pain.
"I hope I have helped you."
"Yes, you have.  Thank you."  The words surprised Peter even
as he said them and it made the man he thought of as the German
laugh.
"Are you willing to continue with this mission?" Emlyn asked.
Peter looked at him in surprise.  "I have a choice?"
"Yes.  At this point you still do.  After what you exper-
ienced ...  You were angry just now.  You might have changed your
mind.  If you have, it is best if you say so now.  This is a very
particular mission, one that requires your total commitment."
"I haven't changed my mind."
"Then your training in tanks begins tomorrow."
Peter looked at him in surprise.
"German tanks, Captain.  Types, performance, terminology,
tactics, forms of military address, insignia, the lot." Emlyn
said. "And this gentleman will be in charge of that." He indicated
the German.  "You may call him Max."
"Are you as goods with tanks as you are with interrogations?"
Peter asked him.
"Better."  There was a slow smile that changed the man's face
completely.  The menace was gone.  He looked almost boyish.  "I
respect tanks," Max said, "especially German tanks.  I served in
them for two years."
