# Chapter 21

beside Peter who was leaning against the wall, his back sup-
ported by pillows from the bed.  They had finished their talk.
Peter looked over at Hans who was sitting on the bed.
"Michael Compton also wants intelligence, if you're willing to
give it to him."
"No," said Hans.
"I didn't think you would," said Peter.  "Neither did he.
But he sent the codes and the mail drops all the same."
Just then they heard soft scuffling sounds in the hall and
turned as one as the door opened.
Madeleine shut the door after herself then leaned back
against it.  She was very pale.  "I just realized ..." Her eyes
went to Karl, then to Peter and finally to Hans.  "We have to
get Peter out of here tonight.  We came out of the cellar
together and when they don't find him, they'll come back here,
perhaps even in the morning.  He can't be here when they come."
"Are you suggesting we take him out?"  Hans was looking at
her intently.
"Yes.  You could put him in the trunk of your car.  I have
relatives in the country.  And with a general ..." She gestured
toward Karl.  "No one would search the car."
"Guy would know," Hans said quietly.
They all heard her slight intake of breath.  Tension was
palpable.
"Guy knows Peter's here, doesn't he, Madaeleine," Hans
said.
"Yes," she said finally.  "He knows.  He's the one who has
been helping me.  He knows you know Peter, that you're the one
Peter came to see.  I didn't tell him," she said quickly.  "He
worked it out for himself.  And I didn't confirm what he said.
I said nothing at all because I didn't know what to say."
"Right now," Karl said, "he only has suspicions, which you
undoubtedly confirmed because you couldn't deny them."  He waved
a deprecating hand.  "My dear, you have handled all this magni-
ficantly.  But while he now has only grave suspicions ...  If we
take Peter out, that will confirm them."
"We know just as much about him," Hans said wearily.  "He's
a Frenchman in a black market operation with Germans, and that
operation is under the aegis of the Gestapo.  And he's willing
to help an American spy?  The danger to him is enormous, unless
he's part of a Gestapo trap."
"No," Madeleine said with a quietness that carried far more
force than bombast.  "What he does, he does for France, always
for France."
"Then he's Resistance, so it's a stalemate," Hans said,
"He won't betray us because he feels we're working for the
Allies and we certainly can't afford to betray him because if he
were caught, the Gestapo would believe what he said and we'd be
dead."
"You know this man is working for France?" Karl asked her.
"You understand, we have to be sure."
"I am sure," Madeleine said.  "He is my cousin.  We
were raised together.  Our families are very close.  Besides,
if he had wanted to betray you, what better time than when you
both were here and Peter was in the closet?"
"He didn't want you involved,"  Karl said.
"Guy is very clever," she said drily.  "He would have taken
care of me, told them I was working with him to trap you."
Karl looked over at Hans who didn't move.
"No matter who takes him out of town." - Karl's eyes were still
on Hans. -  "it's dangerous.  The question that needs to concern
us now is, if we don't take Peter out, how will he get out?"
"He won't get out," said Madeleine harshly. "At least not
in time.  There's no way to get him out of town until the Ges-
tapo is through searching and they may come back before then.
There would be a way out, if he were in good physical condition,
but he's not, so someone will have to take him.
Karl turned to Peter.  "Can you walk down to the car?"
"I will walk dowqn to the car."
"And could you get into the trunk?  It is big enough, but
you'd have to lie on your side.  Curl up.  We could bring a pil-
low for your head and a blanket to cover you."
"I'll manage."
"Where do we take him, Madeleine?" Hans asked.
Her head came around.  There was a red spot on each cheek.
"I will show you where to take him and I will stay there with
him but I will not tell you whose farm it is.  As I said, it's
family."
"That doesn't matter.  We have no need to know," Karl said.
"Madeleine, if you would get dressed and pack what you what to
take for your stay in the country ...  It is logical for you to
leave.  Bombs are falling, the cafe has burned down and you have
relatives in the country who can take care of you.  Tell them
that at the check point. If you were to cry ...  A little hyste-
ria wouldn't hurt." Then he yelled down the stairs for Sergei,
asking what was happening in the street.  At the moment there
was nothing.
"Then come up here," Karl said. "We need help."  He turned
to Hans.  "We'll need the pillows and the duvet.  We'll cover
him with the duvet, not only to keep him warm, but if they do
open the trunk, they may think it's covering her suitcases.
Sergei appeared in the doorway.
"Ready, Hans?" Karl asked.
"Yes, sir."  He moved to Peter, hunkered down and checked
the sling.  "You all right?" he asked softly.
"No."  Peter laughed, then his breath caught.  "Get on my
other side."  There were beads of sweat on his forehead.
Hans moved to Peter's right side and signaled to Sergei
with his head.  Sergei moved to Peter's left side but there was
really nothing he could do except to steady Peter once he was
standing.  It was Hans who helped Peter up.
Guy stood in the deep shadows of a narrow slot of an alley
between two houses that were not quite across the street from
the staff car.   There was just enough light to let him see the
shadow of the staff car but no farther.   There were Germans
everywhere and he knew too well what would happen if a patrol
came down the street at the wrong moment.
But Henri's downstairs apartment was on his right and Henri
had left the kitchen window unlocked.  He could crawl through
that window if he had to.
Guy didn't like waiting, but he had no choice.  He had to
make sure of what happened to the American.  If Madeleine's col-
onel didn't get the American out of Caen, he would have to work
out something quickly.  Even if they did take him, Guy would
have to move just as quickly, getting out of town and to
Pierre's himself and in time to get Peter to the plane.  It
wouldn't be easy.  Three black marias had taken people off to
prison from this side of town alone and the thought of who might
be gone and how many was appalling.
He was listening carefully.  The night was clear and still
and sound traveled well.  There were vague sounds of vehicles
moving, men calling to each other in German, but they were far
away.
Then he stiffened.  Somewhere on the street, a door had
opened. Guy moved a careful three steps forward along the wall
and leaned forward to peer around the corner of the house.  Col-
onel von der Greif was coming down the three shallow front
steps, clasping a big, loose sort of bundle to his chest with
both arms.  Madeleine was behind him carrying a small suitcase.
She opened the back door of the staff car for the general.
Guy couldn't see what they were doing but it became obvious that
Madeleine was in the car but the general wasn't.  When Guy could
see him again, the back passenger door to the car was still open
and the general was standing by the back fender, looking around
carefully.  His bundle was gone.
Apparently satisfied with what he saw, the general walked
around to the back of the car, and bent over the trunk.  After a
minute, the lid began to lift.   He restrained it with his hand
and rose with it until Guy heard the faint sound of it clicking
into place at the top.  Then the general stood, looking around,
probably listening.  Finally he raised his hand.  The door to
the house opened again.
A man who had to be the Russian was the first one out and
he came out sideways. He moved slowly, something Guy understood
the minute he saw the figure in the doorway next to him.   It
was the American and that the Russian was supporting him.  Guy
had a moment of great satisfaction.  He had been right and
Madeleine had succeeded.
The men turned slowly, as if they were hooked together.
Then the Russian moved away, going down one step to face the
American.  Guy's throat constricted with fear that the American
might fall until he saw that he had a hand on the Russians
shoulder and was using him for support.
They were walking across the sidewalk when Guy heard German
voices calling to each other.  This time the voices were not so
distant and they were coming closer.
He ran on his toes back down the alley, toward Henri's
kitchen window.
When Peter got to the sidewalk, he stood for a moment, and
became aware of the sweat that was soaking through his heavy
shirt and streaming down his face, and the tight clench of his
jaw.  He had set himself for a far greater effort than it had
actually been to walk down the stairs.  The discovery was a
great relief. His jaw relaxed.
"Just three or four steps to the car," Hans said softly.
"Then Sergei will help you into the trunk."
He lifted his head to look at Hans, and felt himself smile.
"I'll get there.  ...  No.  Really."  He started forward on his
own.
"Hurry," Karl whispered urgently. "A patrol is coming."
It was three steps, then down the curb.  It ws Hans hover-
ing beside him as he turned.  Sergei had put the trunk lid up.
As he sat, the rim of the trunk cut into his thighs.  They
tilted him backward and sideways, supporting his upper body and
lifting his legs at the same time, as if he was a total invalid,
Peter thought angrily.
But then there was a moment of excruciating pain.  He came
out of it to find himself lying in the trunk on his good side
with his knees bent almost up to his chest.  A pillow was under
his head, and what had to be Madeleine's suitcase was jammed
between his knees and his chest.   "Madeleine's duvet." Hans
voice was quiet.  He felt the soft cover being thrown over him
and had a moment of claustophobic fear.
"We have to completely cover you," Hans said.  "In case
they open the trunk.  Don't make a sound." The trunk lid slammed
down with a hollow boom.
He heard muffled voices coming at him from three sides,
and he started to shake.
As Karl put on his peaked officer's cap and walked out into
the street beside the back passenger door, Madeleine got out of
the car on the other side and stood on the sidewalk, watching.
Hans moved toward her.  The moon shadow made it impossible
to read her face.  "Madeleine," he said quietly and put out his
hand.  She grasped it convulsively.  She was shaking her profile
was impassive.
Sergei leaned against the driver's door as if he weren't
the least bit interested.
Four German soldiers, Waffen SS, were walking down the
middle of the street, rifles at the ready.  Abruptly, as some-
times happened in battle, Hans detatched from himself and
watched what was happening as if from a distance.   It was some-
thing he usually welcomed.  This time he didn't even notice.
The soldiers spread out into a staggered formation as they
came, with two in back to cover the two in front.
"What's going on here," one of leaders said.  "Don't you
know there's a curfew? Everyone is to be indoors.  Where are
your papers?"
"Get Madeleine into the car, Hans," Karl said loudly enough
to be heard.  "I'll take care of this."
"No.  No one moves," the same man said.  "Not until I find
out what's going on. Cover them."
The other lead man stepped up onto the sidewalk, lifted his
rifle and aimed it right at Hans.
Hans slipped his arm around Madeleine and held her to him
tightly.  She had stopped shaking.
The other two soldiers were behind the staff car, one well
off each rear fender.
They were surrounded.
"You there."  The lead man, a sergeant, gestured to Sergei
with his rifle.  "Move away from the car."
"Do as he says, Sergei," Karl said.
The Russian moved, lifting his hands briefly to show
that they were empty.
"Now," said Karl angrily.  "I want to know what this is all
about.  If you have eyes in your head, you can see that I am a
general staff officer.  I want your name, your rank, your serial
number and the name of the unit you are attached to."
The man hesitated.
"Now!" said Karl, "and have your men put down their weap-
ons."
There was some shuffling of feet but otherwise none of them
moved.
"Sir," the sergeant said, "I am SS Sergeant Lars Feldmann,
3nd Brigade, Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler.  We have been given
strict orders to enforce this curfew.  We are to check the iden-
tity of everyone we see on the streets, especially German offi-
cers, regardless of rank.  There are to be no exceptions because
there is a spy in Caen dressed as a German officer.
"I have been told that he is a very big man with black
curly hair," said Karl.  "Do any of us fit that description?"
"Yes, sir.  Though he's dressed as an enlisted man, he does
fit the description."  He gestured toward Sergei.  "Who is he?"
"Tell him who you are, Sergei," Karl said.
"Corporal Sergei Voronov," said Sergei in his thick accent.
"I am Colonel Richter's driver."
"Your papers, please," the sergeant said, "and be careful
when you take them out."
Sergei reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out his pay
book and handed it to the sergeant who hung his rifle on his
shoulder by the strap and took a flashlight off his belt so he
could look at it.
No one else moved.
The sergeant snapped the book shut and handed it back to
Sergei.  "How long have you been a driver?"
"I have driven for Colonel Richter since last spring.
Before that I drove the Colonel General's aide in Berlin."
"That right, sir?"  The sergeant looked at Karl.
"It is," Karl said.
"May I see your papers, sir?"
Karl took out his pay book and slapped it into the ser-
geant's hand.
"Sergeant," Hans said as he propelled Madeleine toward the
rear passenger door of the staff car.  - The man on the sidewalk
kept the rifle on him steadily. - "I am Colonel Johann Richter,
commander of the Panzer regiment headquartered in St. Pierre-
sur-Dives.  Corporal Voronov is my driver and has been since
last spring.  Colonel General Karl von der Greif is the Quarter-
master General of the Wehrmacht.  He is here from Berlin on an
inspection trip."
Madeleine slid into the car.  The man facing Hans lowered
his rifle slightly.
"This woman is exhausted," Hans said, "and we are about to
take her out of this godforsaken city, to relatives in the coun-
try.  She was nearly killed in the bombing raid last night and
tonight her house was searched.  God knows what would happen to
her tomorrow if she stayed." He slammed the passenger door for
emphasis.  The two men behind the car lowered their rifles.   "I
would suggest you get through with this as quickly as possible
so that we can be on our way."
"I'm sorry, sir," the sergeant said as he handed Karl back
his book.  "I am simply following orders."  Then he moved around
the car.  "May I see your papers?"
Hans pulled out his pay book and handed it over.
The sergeant looked at it briefly, then handed it back.
"Now, if you would open the trunk, please?"
"For God's sake," said Hans.
"I am ordered to look into every vehicle I find on the
street, to make sure there is no one hidden inside."
"Open the trunk, Sergei," Hans said in apparent exasper-
ation.  "We have to settle this and get out of here."
Sergei reached into the car and pulled the keys out of the
ignition.  Then he walked around to the back of the car and
unlocked the trunk.  As he pulled up the lid, there was a
throaty purr of motorcycles that made them all turn, including
Sergei who was holding the trunk lid only half way up.
Two motorcycles came around the corner, their black out
headlights eerie white crosses shining through the night.  Two
more came, followed by a staff car, then two more motorcycles.
The cavalcade slowed, then stopped in the middle of the
street, even with the rear of the staff car.   One German offi-
cer leapt out each side of the rear of the second staff car.
The slimmer man approached while the other deployed the motor-
cyclists.  It was Erich von Feber.
"Sergeant, why do you have rifles pointed at these German
officers?"
"It is past curfew.  We are checking their papers and
searching their car, as ordered."
"This general is here from Berlin on an inspection tour.  I
also have orders.  When it was discovered that the town was
being searched, I was ordered to bring this escort to see that
the Colonel General got out of Caen without any difficulties."
"I have not finished searching the car ... sir."
"And I say that you have."  Erich von Feber's face was only
inches from the sergeant's.  His voice was menacingly quiet.
"Do you have any question that these two men are who they say
they are."
"No."
"Then I would say that the SS is very definitely exceeding
it's authority."  He moved back.  "Shut the trunk, Sergei.  Ser-
geant, you and your men stand easy."
The lid slammed shut.
The SS men hesitated.
Von Feber signaled with his left hand and there were the
six double clicks of six rifles being readied to fire.
"SS, stand easy," the sergeant said angrily.
"Move on," said von Feber.
The sergeant turned without either a word or a salute and
moved into the middle of the street.  "Form up on me," he said
to his men.
When they were ready, he marched them down the street in
the direction from which they had come.  When they had disap-
peared around the corner, Schuster said, "At ease."  The men
lowered their rifles.  Then, "Back to your motorcycles.  We will
be the lead car.  The general's car following.  Deploy your men
appropriately, Sergeant."
"Major Schuster," said Hans.  "Before we move on, I need to
talk briefly with you and Major von Feber.  If you will, follow
me into the house.  The door has to be locked anyway.  General,
would you like to come or will you wait in the car?"
"I'll see to the lady," said Karl.  "And Majors."  He took
in a long breath.  "Thank you very much."
Sergei opened the rear passenger door and Karl disappeared
into the car.
"Major von Feber," said Hans when they were in the hall,
"who gave you those orders?"
Erich von Feber came to attention.  "No one, sir.  I acted
totally on my own responsibility."
"We acted on our responsibility, Erich," Schuster said.
"Remember, those are my men out there."
"Thank you both.  You helped more than you could possibly
know."  He laughed nervously.  "I do need your help getting out
of town, but before you give it to me, you need to know what
you're doing.  I made the mistake once of not giving you a
choice, Schuster.  I'm not going to do that again.  You both
have the right to choose.  My American cousin is in the trunk of
the staff car.  He is the man who came out of the cellar with
me, the man the Gestapo is searching for.  A member of my family
is with British Intelligence.  He knows me well.  It was he who
saw to it that the Allies sent Peter to see me, to find out
about the plot and how serious we are about it, and to open
lines of communication. If he's found, you know what will hap-
pen."
There was a moment of silence.  Von Feber didn't move.
Schuster shifted from one foot to the other.  Then he cleared
his throat.  "What do you want me to do?"
"Us, Stefan," Erich von Feber said to Schuster.  Then, .
"What do you want us to do, Herr Colonel."
"You don't have any questions?" Hans was having to talk
around a lump in his throat.
"Just to ask where you plan to take him and how we can help
you get him there," said von Feber.  "There will be plenty of
time for questions when he's gone."
"The two of you ... When we get out of town, we'll stop.
You take the Colonel General in your car, back to St. Pierre sur
Dives.  Tell Schmidt that I am taking Madeleine to relatives in
the country, some place safer than Caen."
"We'll take care of it, sir," said von Feber.
Schuster cleared his throat.  "We'll take care of every-
thing," he said.  "You just ... be careful."   Then he opened
the door.
There were only two road blocks on the road to the west
and, given the escort, no touble at all.  Within twenty minutes,
Karl was in Schuster's staff car, heading east toward St. Pierre
sur Dives.
Madeleine was leaning forward in the back seat peering out
through the front windshield, watching the road.  It wasn't easy
to see.  The moon was casting even deeper shadows as it moved
down toward the horizon and the black out headlights were almost
no help at all.
"Slower, please," she said, and Sergei slowed the car to a
crawl.
"There," she said loudly, pointing to the right.  "The next
turn to the right.  Right.  It's just a track.  Don't miss it."
Sergei was just edging the car into the turn when a man
appeared beside the car and slapped his hand on the window
beside Hans.
Sergei jerked the wheel over and tramped on the accelera-
tor.
"Stop," Madeleine cried.  "It's Guy!"
Sergei half stood on the brake.  The car shuddered and
slid to a stop.  The rear passenger door opened.  Guy bumped
Hans over as he got in.  "Go," Guy said in German.  "Quick."  He
slammed the door and collapsed back in the seat.
"Do as he says, Sergei," Hans said.  As the car took off,
Hans asked Guy, in French, what was wrong.
"A patrol," said Guy.  "They were moving toward the barn."
"What about Pierre?" Madeleine asked anxiously.
"I don't know," Guy said.  "Colonel, either we drive down
the road and wait for the patrol to leave, or we go on south, on
this road, for about 2 miles, then turn left for another mile.
It's where I was planning to take him anyway.  How is he?"
"Twenty minutes ago he was stiff and cold.  As to how he is
now ..."  Hans shrugged.
"If all goes well, there should be a cart there so I can
haul him in.  If there is, he won't have to walk at all."
"You have an excellent organization if you can arrange this
on such short notice."
"It needs to be excellent, Colonel," Guy said quietly.
"Will we be seen when we drop you off?"
"Not unless you go on into the woods."
"Still, we'll stop just down the road and get him out of
the trunk.  Put him in the back seat.  Then he can warm up a bit
and move his arms and legs, so he's not so stiff.  It will be
faster and easier when we drop you off."
"Just up here, Sergei," said Guy in German.  "Turn left.
There's a pull off about a third of a mile down, on the right.
We can stop there."
"What are we going to do about each other, Guy?" Hans
asked.
"As far as I am concerned, Herr Colonel," said Guy, "we are
not going to do anything about each other.  It's a standoff.  I
will take care of this business for you because it is in my
interest.  It is in your interest to let me do it.  I have the
feeling that that is not the only place where our interests
coincide.  I want an end to this war and there will be no real
end until all of you leave France to the French and go home."
"Anyone who doesn't want peace is a fool," said Hanssstif-
fly.  "And there can never be true peace when one people holds
another in subjugation."
"Then we each have the best interests of our respective
countries at heart."
"I would say that's true."
"You are a good man, colonel," said Guy.  Then he leaned
forward in the seat.  "Pull off here, Sergei."
Hans, Sergei and Guy got out of the car and stood, looking
and listening.  The moon was setting.  Nothing seemed to move
in the darkness and the only sounds were a faint soughing of the
wind in the grass and the ticks of the cooling engine.
"All right, Sergei," said Hans softly.  They all moved
around to the back of the car, treading softly.
The click of the trunk lid as it settled at the top made
all of them wince.
"Are we there?"  Peter's voice was little more than a
croak.
"Not quite," said Hans who then explained what they were
going to do.
Getting Peter out of the trunk was not an easy matter and
might not have been possible without doing him some damage if it
weren't for Sergei.  Peter gave one soft cry of pain, and then
he was standing, reeling slightly, supported by Sergei as he
stretched out first one leg, then the next while the other two
men looked around anxiously.
They settled him into the back seat on the driver's side
with Madeleine in the middle.  Guy was in the front with Sergei
so he could give directions.
They crept along the road in silence with the headlights
out.  For Hans it was as if they had been in the staff car for-
ever and that he would ride through eternity in it with his
heart pounding and his mouth dry.  Guy's quiet "Stop" startled
them all.  Guy darted out of the car before it was totally
stopped and disappeared into the darkness.  They waited, breath-
less, ears straining until they heard the sound of wooden wheels
crunching over hard ground.
Sergei got out and opened the rear passenger door.
"Stay where you are, Madeleine," Hans said quietly.  Then
he got out, went around the car and helped Peter out.
"Are you all right?" Hans asked when Peter was standing.
All he got in reply was a breathless little laugh and then
the small two wheel cart was there beside them.
Sergei lowered Peter down into it.  "All right?" he asked
Peter in German.
"I'll live," said Peter.
"I sincerely hope so," said Sergei.
"We must go," said Guy.
"Peter ...," said Hans.
"Yes, John," said Peter in English.
"You know...  Stay safe and tell mother ..."  He couldn't
go on.
"I know what to tell her," Peter said, "and your son.  Good
luck."
Guy was between the traces.  He lifted them, tilting the
cart's box back and began to move forward.  Sergei pushed from
the back to get him started as Hans walked alongside.
"Good luck yourself," Hans said in a voice that was barely
audible over the crunch and creak of the wheels.
Then he stood and watched them disappear into the darkness.
Finally he got back into the car.
"Sergei," he said.  "Go straight on down this road until I
tell you to stop.  Then come back slowly.  I don't like that
patrol Guy was talking about.   If we're stopped, we got lost
looking for Madeleine's cousin's house.  You remember how to get
back to the turnoff for the barn?"
"Yes, sir."  He started up the car.
Madeleine reached out and touched Hans' arm.  He took her
hand and laced their fingers together.
Peter saw and heard everything with great clarity, the
rumble of the wooden wheels on the ground, Guy's increasingly
heavy breathing, the darkening of the night as the moon disap-
peared, allowing stars to cover the sky in a breathtaking dis-
play.  He was past fear.  Being locked in the truck with the SS
about to find him had taken all that away.  He still wasn't sure
what had happened.  There had been the sound of motorcycles, a
confusion of voices.  Then the trunk lid slammed down again and
they were off into jostling and cold and pain and stiffness.
But that was nothing after sheer terror.
He had had to accept that there was nothing he could do.
His life was in the hands of other people, had been since he
walked up the stairs to Madeleine's attic.  Now, instead of
fighting that, he sank into it, received it with gratitude.  All
the decisions were someone else's to make.  All he had to endure
was discomfort and, for moment, that were minor.
They were moving into woods.  The darkness deepened and the
sounds became a bit more muffled.  The cart tilted slightly,
first to one side and then the other as it jolted over tree
roots.  The pain of that made Peter sweat despite the chill.
Then, abruptly, everything stopped and he heard voices whisper-
ing.
"Can you fire a pistol?"
Guy's voice so close at hand startled him.  "Yes," Peter
said.  "Even a rifle if I had to."  He would do anything he had
to.
"Here."
His hand closed around what turned out to be the butt of a
Colt .45 and he wondered where they could have gotten it.
"You know how to use this?"
"Yes."
"The plane is coming," Guy said.  "Soon.  When it lands,
you must move fast.  We'll have you standing and ready, and
we'll help you into the plane.  There's a step ladder.  We have
men guarding the area to keep it clear.  Sometimes when people
find out there's a plane coming in, it turns into a circus.
They see it as good news and want to be part of that." His voice
was dry.  "We can't have it this time.  And, of course the Ger-
mans could always come.  If they do, we should have plenty of
warning.  The gun is in case there's not."
Peter gripped the revolver butt tightly to stop the shaking
in his hand.  "I won't get caught."
"Good."  Guy stood.  "All right, Alois."
Obviously Alois was in the traces now because Guy was walk-
ing behind the cart.  There was a rifle in his hand.
Sergei had turned the car around and they were heading back
down the road at a crawl with the lights out.  Despite the cold,
the back windows were part way down, so they could hear whatever
there was to hear.  They sat in silence, ears straining, but
there was nothing to hear, eyes straining but there was nothing
to see except the greater darkness of the stubble of overgrown
weeds and grass at the roadsides which was passing in near hyp-
notic slow motion.
As they came around a curve, they heard a plane and saw a
the black-out headlights of a truck moving toward them well down
the road.   Sergei stopped the car, put it in reverse, then
backed around the curve again.
"Stop."  Hans got out of the car.  "There's a farm lane.
We'll back into it and wait.  I'll guide you."
They backed into the farm lane with Hans walking beside the
car as fast as he dared and talking softly through the open win-
dow -  "Sharp left.  Enough.  No.  A little more left.  Now
straight."  Then, "Further back.  They're coming."  It was
little more than a dirt track and he had to move more slowly
than he wanted to on the uneven ground.
One truck went by, then a second.  Both ground to a stop.
Everything stopped.  No one moved.  The only sounds were
the idling truck engines and ticks of their own engine cooling.
Then the truck engines roared to life.  The first one
backed into the track, the taillights clearly visible as the
truck moved toward them.
"Troop trucks,"  Sergei whispered.
Hans just nodded.  His mouth was too dry for words.
Then the truck was pulling away from them, back into the
road.  It was only turning around.  The second one did the same.
The relief was enormous.
It was then that they heard the sound of the plane.
The trucks speeded up.
"My God," said Madeleine.  Her voice was shaking.
Peter was on his feet and moving as the plane landed.  The
man beside him carried a step ladder and he was grateful.  With-
out it, he could never have gotten into that plane.
The Lysander turned at the end of the L and waited, barely
restraining itself as someone inside passed down packages.
"Wait in the plane," Guy called up to the man who was pass-
ing out the packages.  "There's someone here who has to go back
and he'll need help."  Then, impatiently.  "Go, Peter.  Help
him, Alois."  The ladder was in place.  Alois guided his hand to
the top of the painter's step ladder, then moved to help Guy
brace it.  Peter put his foot on the first rung and went up
sideways, one rung at a time, putting pain aside to move as fast
as he could.  When he could, he reached for the edge of the back
cockpit.  A hand grabbed his and guided it to a hand hold.  He
was at the top of the ladder, half sitting on the edge raising
one leg to swing it over and in when someone started shouting.
"Take off!  Germans!"    As if for emphasis, there were gun
shots in the distance.
Peter got his right leg in.
The plane started taxiing.
Flares lit the night and a mortar shell spumed up dirt
close behind them.
Peter tried to swing in his left leg but all he did was
slide backwards.  He was off balance, the hand hold hindering
as much as helping him.  There was a moment of frozen terror as
he started to tilt over the side.  But then there were arms
around his waist pulling at him.  He heard curses in his ear, in
French, then, "Let go.  Let go."  He willed his hand to let go
and he was hauled in on top of the Frenchman.  The plane jerked
and shuddered.  He felt a terrible pain as his shoulder jarred.
Then he hit his head and there was nothing.
As the plane started taxiing, Guy fell away from it, taking
Alois and the ladder with him.  He was rolling free of the lad-
der when Alois disappeared in an explosion of dirt that lifted
Guy, and threw him down again a few feet away.  He lay there,
half curled in a fetal position, ears ringing, seeing the
flares, other geysers of dirt, the lines of tracer arcing into
the sky, chasing the plane without catching it.  There was no
sound to any of this.  There was only a tinny screeching in his
ears that was exquisitely painful.
He tried to turn over, but he couldn't move.  Not his hand,
not his arm, nothing.  And he had no feeling.  Only the pain in
his ears.  He saw German soldiers running in his direction at a
crouch, weaving across the open space with bayonets fixed.  He
lay there, fixing his eyes on a tuft of dead grass, praying they
would think he was dead, feeling in an odd detatched way that he
might already be.
He didn't feel the bayonet that went into his chest, but an
all emcompassing pain soared deep in his chest.  Blood rose in
his throat, into his mouth.  He was choking, drowning in his own
blood.
Madeleine, Sergei and Hans were all standing outside the
car, watching and waiting.  Hans' mouth was dry.  His palms were
wet.   Then he saw the flares and heard in the distant tinny
thwunks of mortar fire, the tattoo of machine guns and the roar
of an airplane struggling to rise.  He started shaking.  Made-
leine leaned against him.  She was crying.  He put his arm
around her, holding her to him absently as he willed the plane
to rise.  Then he could see it, the small black silhouette of a
monoplane with the wing at the top, back-lit by flares.  Lines
of tracer fire reached out, trying to grab it.
"Please," he said. Then again, more softly, "Please."
The plane exploded into a fire ball that hung in the air
for an instant before flying into a million brilliant pieces.
The force of it was so shattering that even the car recoiled.
There was a wailing cry from Madeleine and a stifled sob
from Sergei.  Hans stood in stony silence looking at where the
plane had been.  There were tears streaming down his face.
As if in respect, the sounds of battle sputtered out and
the flares faded to nothing.
They were left to silence and darkness.
Finally Hans shifted his weight from one foot to the other.
As if that was a signal, Sergei and Mdeleine moved.  Car doors
opened then clicked softly closed as each on got into the car.
"Where should I go?" Sergei asked in a whisper.
"Back to the road, Sergei."  Hans voice was thick.  "We've
got to find another way home."
