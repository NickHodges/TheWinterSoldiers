# Chapter 10

One of Guy Ardiet's waiters appeared in his office doorway.
"Henri asked me to tell you that Colonel Richter is here. He just
came in."
"Good! Where is he?"
"Henri put them at number 4. Ringside.  One of mine." He
smiled. That was a recent promotion. "Another officer is with him.
A major. The colonel is the smaller of the two and he has black
hair."

"You look better," Georg said as he studied Hans across the
table.
"Do I?"
"Yes. And I'm surprised."
Hans smiled. "What he gives with one hand, he takes back with
the other."
"You didn't ask why I was surprised."
"Why are you surprised?" Hans asked amiably.
"Because of the reports I've been getting. You're pushing
yourself and pushing everyone else even harder. You need to stop
it. The troops are so well trained that they're on the brink of
being over-trained. They're exhausted and so are you. You need to
let up on them as much as you need to let up on yourself. Relax.
You can't save the world in a day. Three day passes to Paris on a
rotating basis. You, too. Do you realize you haven't set foot out
of this division's assigned area since you got here lo these many
weeks ago? Not one day off. And certainly not enough of the right
kind of exercise."
"Who's complaining?"
"It would be easier to tell you who's not complaining. And
they're not really complaining. They're proud of the way this unit
is shaping up, but they're also concerned."
"You've been talking to Ulrich."
"And everyone else. Schuster and Schmidt, to name two among
many. And I haven't been talking to them, they've been talking to
me, hard and fast and more than once. While they're worried about
the men, they're even more worried about you. Even Sergei, that
model of rectitude and keeping his mouth shut has had his say. You
need to get away, to Paris. Anywhere. Go riding. You haven't
been riding since you got here. And you need to get out to dinner,
see your friends. Like me. I haven't seen you in more than two
weeks."
"So far I haven't found this 'out to dinner' particularly
relaxing," Hans was beginning to be annoyed. "You've done nothing
but talk business and my business at that."
"If you won't take time off, at least get more exercise."
"Yes. Of course," Hans said. "I'll spend more time pacing the
floor in my office. At least I can do that alone. No bodyguards
needed. God in heaven, that's humiliating. 'No German officer or
enlisted man is to walk anywhere alone.'" He mimicked their gen-
eral's high-pitched voice to good effect. "And I assume that would
apply to riding as well." He didn't want to ride. He hadn't
touched a horse since that day in Russia.
"You know the general's right," Georg said absently. He was
looking around for the waiter.
"Yes, I know he's right, but it's galling. It means that we're
at least as much prisoners in France as the French are. Maybe more
because at least the French can be at home with their families."
"Oh?" said Georg. "Perhaps those who aren't taken and shot in
reprisal or sent off into forced labor in Germany can be at home
with their families.
"Would you like to be at home with your son, not sure from one
day to the next whether he - or you - would be suddenly gone with-
out a trace?"  Georg began rearranging his silver. "How is he?"
Hans reached into his inner jacket pocket and brought out a
thin leather traveling picture frame which he shoved in Georg's
direction. "My mother sent this in one of the rare Red Cross let-
ters she's allowed to send. It came two days ago."
Georg regarded the picture soberly. It was wonderful. The
head and shoulders of a small boy with blonde curly hair. He was
laughing and his right arm was up as if he were reaching for some-
thing.
"A beautiful boy, Hans." Georg handed it back.
"Yes." He folded up the frame and put it back into his pocket.
"And my beautiful boy is as safe as it's possible for a German
child to be these days. I remind myself daily that I am grateful
for that."
"But you also remind yourself that you miss him and resent not
being able to watch him grow up."
"As you resent missing watching your daughters grow up? To say
nothing of missing Birgid." Georg and Birgid were each half of the
other.
"At least I can see them whenever I get leave. Your son ..."
The waiter had arrived.  Drinks were ordered.
"My son is inaccessible. My whole family is inaccessible."
Hans said when he had gone. "So is yours as long as we have to sit
here in France." He leaned forward keeping his voice low, his anger
palpable. "We're hostage to each other. We hold France hostage
and she in turn holds us hostage to keeping it that way."
"So, who really wins in the end?" Georg lifted his glass in
mock salute. "No one."
"Messieurs?"
They both jerked back and looked up.
It was the waiter carrying a bottle of wine. From the condi-
tion of the label, it was very old wine indeed. "Messieurs," he
said again, solemnly this time, "this comes, as does the dinner,
with the compliments of the owner." He turned away, uncorked the
bottle and poured a bit for Hans to taste.
"Thank you." Hans sensed that a bit of ceremony was required so
he lifted his glass, swirled the contents gently, then inhaled the
aroma.
His eyebrows went up in appreciation. He sipped, held the wine
in his mouth to consider it briefly before he swallowed. "This is
superb."
The waiter inclined his head gravely. "Yes, sir. I am grate-
ful for your appreciation. It is among the very best France has to
offer."
A white-coated young man arrived with a tray.
"As you can appreciate, at times the menu is somewhat limited,"
the waiter said apologetically. "So the owner would like the priv-
ilege of supplying a special dinner for you. A gesture of welcome,
he said."  He was looking at Hans in inquiry.
Hans wasn't sure he liked this. The Norman French were not
noted for open handed hospitality in the best of times and occupy-
ing German officers in 1943 were not evidence that times were at
their best.
"The first course." The waiter gestured toward the tray the
young man had set on the portable holder. "Onion soup, if that
meets with your approval?"
"Georg?" Hans asked.
"Any man who has such superb taste in wine can order my dinner
any time he wants to, especially since he's also paying the bill."
It was an effort for Hans to keep a straight face as he trans-
lated Georg's comments, not only from German to French, but into
something more suitable.  "And please tell the gentleman that we
look forward to meeting him and thanking him in person." Since he
didn't trust all this largess, he wanted to see the man behind it.
The waiter inclined his head in assent, then placed the appro-
priate plate and bowl in front of each man, and served the soup. A
small tray of freshly baked rolls and real butter was placed
between them.
They ate and drank for a time in contented silence. The soup
was as superb as the wine but the bread was best of all.
"I take it, we have failed again," Georg said.
"What failed?"
"The latest effort. Yesterday, wasn't it?  I take it it
didn't come off."
Hans looked around. The restaurant was full. There was the
hum of conversation and periodic spates of laughter. Smoke from
countless cigarettes rose and spread out into a thickening cloud
near the ceiling. No one seemed to be paying any attention to them
and even if they were, their table was far enough from the rest to
make it hard for anyone to hear. "I don't want to talk about it.
I'm tired of talking about it and I'm even tired of being tired of
it. I almost don't want to hope for it any more. The failures are
too excruciating. I've told Karl not to have any more alerts sent
through. It's too dangerous. Just the code word when it's done."
He tore a roll apart, scattering crumbs of crust far and wide.
"General von Kluge was going to come in with us."
There was a grunt of surprise from Georg. "Was going to? What
happened? A general in command of millions of troops on the Rus-
sian front would be worth his weight in gold."
"He was in an accident." Hans' buttered a small piece of roll
very carefully. "He's in traction in a Berlin hospital and is
likely to be there for months. He's part of why I'm sick of hop-
ing."
"And I don't suppose Rommel's been willing to commit himself
yet either."
The shake of Hans' head was so small as to be almost nonex-
istent. He had heard somewhere that having hope and having it
smashed was worse than having no hope at all. He was beginning to
believe it.
The waiter was a welcome interruption.
He had brought Dover sole which had been allowed to speak for
itself. It was sauteed with a light dusting of herbs and was sup-
erb, as was the wine which came with it.
"So, when are you going to Paris?" Georg asked. "And will you
take me with you?"
"Don't push me. I'll go when I have either the time - which
may be never - or a reason, and not before."
The lights dimmed and a spotlight turned on a woman who had
perched herself on a stool near the piano. She was full breasted
but with long slim lines, all of which were displayed to great
advantage by an elegantly simple black strapless dress. Her face
was more interesting than beautiful with a wide mouth, wide set
eyes and the high cheek bones that would make her even more attrac-
tive at 40 than she was now.
The piano played an introduction and she started to sing.

Madeleine's singing wasn't up to her usual standards, at least
not at first. Guy had told her the German colonel he wanted her to
meet was here and she was furious. He hadn't ordered her to do
anything about it, or even tried to give her reasons why she
should, but she knew that was what he wanted and even just knowing
was too much. She hated it. At the moment she even hated Guy. As
far as she was concerned, he had turned into a selfish pig and she
didn't intend to do his dirty work for him, especially if it
involved a German officer.
She sang through her anger, about love lost or betrayed or
somehow gone awry and even when she was somewhat mechanical - as
she was when the set began - she had been doing it for so long that
while she wasn't superb, she was still very good indeed.
There was a certain piquancy for her about singing such songs
here, with Charles at the piano, even after all these years. Her
voice caressed him even as his fingers on the keys caressed her, as
if the violent ecstasy of their all too brief affair had left a
physical trace. That trace was a gift to them both, a gift they
were making good use of now.
So, gradually, she forgot Guy and his German and warmed to her
task, using that living memory to sing of love lost or betrayed or
somehow gone awry with more heart. And, toward the end of the set,
to sing of love found with the anger born of the sure knowledge of
the inevitable pain of loss or betrayal, the sureness that somehow
things would go awry.
There was no joy in her anymore, no hope in the waiting for
love. The initial ecstasy of those past loves had turned into too
much pain for her ever to want to love again, which lent those
songs great power. So, though the smoke of innumerable cigars and
cigarettes continued to rise, and wine and brandy and coffee were
sipped, there weren't the periodic swells of murmured conversation
or the scraping of silver on china. The house was very still
indeed.
As the last notes died, there was a collective sigh of silence
before throats were cleared and a spattering of applause began. It
grew until it was louder than anything Guy Ardiet had ever heard in
this cafe or in any other. And then she was smiling her dazzling
professional smile, and inclining her head in acknowledgment before
sliding off in that peculiarly feline way she had of leaving the
stage.
Guy Ardiet knew he had been right. She would make him a for-
tune.

"She's very good, isn't she," Georg said finally.
A nod was Hans' only reply. He was dissecting an excellent
breast of chicken with phenomenal care.
"And lovely. Yes." The word trailed off but Hans didn't look
up. "In fact, I think it would do us both good if we could talk
her into joining us for a glass of this excellent wine."
With that Hans did look up, in alarm.
"You were mesmerized with her, old son." Georg said with
a smile born of surprise. "Wouldn't have thought she was your
type at all. You like small, fine-boned women. This one is almost
Junoesque. And that cloud of hair ... It looks like an unmade bed,
or better yet, as if she had just gotten out of one, preferably
yours."
Hans rolled his eyes and went back to his chicken.
"Are you gentlemen enjoying your dinner?"
"Very much," they said almost in unison. Both of them realized
at once who this had to be.
"Guy Ardiet at your service. This is my establishment."
"Then won't you sit and enjoy a glass of this excellent wine
with us," Georg said expansively and indicated the chair next to
him.
M. Ardiet sat and looked from one of them to the other.
"I am Major Georg Brandt, surgeon in charge of the military
hospital here. And this is Colonel Johann Richter."
"It is my pleasure to serve you both." Then, to Hans, "One of
your officers, Major Wagner, has been most kind to my Aunt Helene
and her daughter. He prevented their house in Verson from being
requisitioned for the army. To do that, he had to move in himself
but they say that he is a most considerate tenant."
"He's a most considerate man," Hans said.
"He would seem to be," Guy agreed.
The waiter appeared and, without having to be asked, poured out
the rest of the bottle of wine, including a glass for Guy. "I very
much appreciate what the major has done. If he hadn't moved in,
they would have been forced to move out and God knows what would
have happened to the house."
"Or anything left in it." Georg lifted his glass toward him.
Guy's look of surprise turned to amused speculation.
"Is it to Major Wagner's consideration that we owe this excel-
lent dinner?" Hans asked to break the silence.
"By no means. He has had his own dinner. A few days ago.
With two of his subordinates. They seemed to have quite a happy
time.
"We are a large family, especially when you include those whose
last name is not Ardiet. And the family is everywhere in Normandy.
For instance, your order holding up the last maneuvers for three
days let farmers finish the second cutting of hay before it could
be flattened. Two of those farmers are uncles and another is a
cousin. Also your rules earlier in the summer about the grain
fields... We will have good grain crops this year. It is greatly
appreciated." A small smile. "And you have insisted on a fair
price for farm goods received. Something else that is appreciated.
It seems that Major Wagner isn't the only officer in your regiment
who can be considerate." He raised his glass toward Hans then
drank.
"Thank you. And to you." Hans raised his glass and Georg fol-
lowed suit. "For this excellent dinner."
"And the remarkable entertainment." Georg added.
There was nothing for Hans to do but drink to that.
"She is marvelous." Georg said.
Hans watched him warily. Georg was positively oozing charm.
When he was in that sort of mood, he was liable to do anything.
"No one better," Guy said. "She is also my cousin."
"A talented family." Georg's eyes were twinkling. "Could we
meet her?"
He really had done 'anything', Hans thought with exasperation.
There was a pause that was just a fraction too long. "I will
see what I can do."
Hans hoped it was nothing.

"I told you," said Madeleine evenly when Guy asked her about it
a few minutes later. "No German officers." The words were a bit
garbled since she was applying lipstick at the time, but there was
no mistaking the meaning.
"This time it's the Germans who are asking. And it is important
or I wouldn't have asked you again. Not after the reception I got
the last time."
She put the lipstick down on the scarred table top, studied
herself critically in the mirror, then turned to look at him. "I
told you. No German officers, no men of any kind. Keep after me
about it and I'll quit."
"I know how badly you need this job."
"I don't need any job that badly."
"Madeleine..." He looked away, tapping his toe as he consid-
ered. "It really is important," he said finally. "And it's not
money."
"It's always money with you."
"No." He shook his head. "That's not true. Not that I don't
like money. I do. You're right about that." He leaned forward to
speak almost into her ear. "But what you don't know ... This is
for the Resistance. The black market operation is for the Resis-
tance. Everything I get from the black market operation goes into
the Resistance."
"What about the improvements to this restaurant?" She didn't
want to believe him, couldn't afford to believe him. And even if
she did believe him, it wouldn't matter. She was even through with
the Resistance.
He flushed. "Even those are for the Resistance. I admit, they
won't hurt if this place survives the war. But it makes this cafe
into a place where German officers like to spend a great deal of
time."
"And money."
"And money." He agreed ngrily. "Yes. They spend a great deal
of money and that helps the Resistance as well. France is the only
thing that matters right now. I'll worry about money after we get
the last German off French soil.
"The Madeleine I used to know would have figured it out for
herself long ago, and she would have been with the Resistance heart
and soul. What happened to you in Paris?"
"Too much." She picked up her hair brush and attacked her hair.
"I didn't think there was anyone or anything in this world that you
cared about except money." She stopped and looked up at him in the
mirror. "I think I may even be impressed."
"Then you'll do it?" He couldn't keep the excitement out of
his voice.
"No."
"My God!" He waved his arms in exasperation. "What does it
take to get through to you?"
"I'm not for sale, Guy." She was so angry that there was no
tone, no inflection at all to the words. "I'm not for sale for
money or for the Resistance or even to save my life. I hate this
war. It is so stupid I can't believe it exists. Only men could
have dreamed up the nightmare we're living through. So I'll leave
it to the men of both sides. You settle it yourselves and leave me
out of it. The Germans will leave eventually, and then perhaps I
will go back to Paris. I haven't decided yet. All I have decided
is that men have cost me too much and I'm through paying so don't
ask again."
There was a tap on the door. "Time, Madeleine."
"Coming, Charles." Then, "Is there anything else, Guy?" It was
said with a politeness that was an insult.
He stormed out, almost knocking over a surprised Charles in the
process.

It took time and a real effort for Madeleine to forget about
Guy and get into the second set which was both different from the
first and yet precisely the same. It helped that she didn't know
which of the many officers the German was or where he was sitting.
She might have been curious enough to look and that would have been
distracting.
By the time she was half way through, her eyes were coming back
again and again to one man. He was German and an officer but some-
how that didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was his face.
She recognized the face if not the man, the utter world-weariness,
the fatigue, the loneliness but most of all the pain because it was
also her own. She tried to look away and when she couldn't, she
used the pain he was creating in her. She fed off it, burned it for
energy, trying to use it up in the process. But he was looking at
her too steadily. His eyes held her with an intensity that was
palpable, feeding her pain while he shared it.
She left the stage, shook off both Guy and Charles and strode
into the bar where she ordered a brandy that she drank far too
quickly. She ordered another, but men were beginning to hover -
including Guy and Charles - and she couldn't bear that. So she
left the brandy on the bar and walked into the dining room and up
to the table where the German was sitting. She stood behind an
empty chair and looked at him. He was looking back at her very
carefully. "Do I know you?" she asked finally. Her voice was soft,
hesitant, a voice that Guy Ardiet would not have recognized.
The German rose slowly. He wasn't a big man, barely taller
than she was, and very thin.
"I don't think so." Then there was a small smile that she
liked a great deal. "In fact I'm sure you don't. You're not the
sort of woman a man could forget. I am Colonel Johann Richter and
this is Georg Brandt and we would both be very pleased if you would
join us." He indicated the chair next to his.
Had there been any triumph in his face, or the faintest hint of
the joy of the chase, she would have been able to turn around and
leave. There wasn't. There was nothing, not even pain. His eyes
were shuttered against her. Still, she hesitated.
"It would give me pleasure," he said quietly.
She looked at him in surprise, as if such a thing as simple
pleasure was impossible in this life. Then her head came down in a
quick nod of assent, and he pulled out the chair. She sat.

They barely noticed when Georg left. Georg was not offended,
simply surprised and bemused and he left as soon as he felt he
decently could. They did not miss him.
"I had a husband," she said abruptly.
"And I had a wife."
There were tears in her eyes. "And a son?"
"I have a son."
"Where is he?"
"With my mother and stepfather."
"So you can see him."
There was a barely perceptible negative shake of the head.
She looked away. "I had a son."
He was sitting very still.
"You are a German officer." She was looking at him again, her
eyes merciless as they took in his uniform, traveling up and down,
from side to side. "I don't like German officers."  There was
a pause as her eyes stopped at his neck. "What is the medal
for?"
"Being a German officer."
"A very good German officer?"
"I'm afraid so."
She looked away again. "I don't like this war."
"Neither do I."
There was a moment of silence.
"I think I will leave now." But she didn't rise.
"May I see you again?"
"Why would you want to?"
That brought a smile.
"Only that?" There was sadness in her voice.
"You are a remarkably ..." He was looking at her matter-of-
factly, studying her as she had studied him. "It's hard to say
what you are. You aren't beautiful in the conventional sense.
It's something better than that. And that has to be part of it
because that is part of what you are. Perhaps I would want to see
you because you don't like the war and you don't like German offi-
cers. So if I were with you, I wouldn't have to be at war and I
wouldn't have to be a German officer."
"You would like that?" The thought seemed to surprise her.
"I would like that very much."
Her eyes held his as she rose and while he rose in acknowledg-
ment of that. Then there was the faintest nod of agreement and she
was gone.
