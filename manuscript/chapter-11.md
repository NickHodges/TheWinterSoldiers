# Chapter 11

It was four weeks later and Peter Harris was, once again,
walking up the long drive from the crofter's cottage to the manor
house for a conference in the library.

He had completed his training with Max four days before and
had parted from him with genuine regret.  There had been two other
men with him on that part of the course and Max had trained them
well.  He was tough and fair on the course, relaxed and very good
company on their rare evenings off.  Only German was spoken, with a
variety of accents, and Peter felt secure with the military idiom,
both general and technical.

As much time as they had spent together, he knew very little
about the other three, including their real names.  They all used
only first names, their cover names, including Max.  All he did
know was that the other two trainees were Jews, which needed no
further explanation, and that Max was Austrian, not German, and
that he was a medical student.

He had spent the past three days with maps, charts and photo-
graphs, some aerial, others from what looked like people's vacation
scrapbooks.  So he knew he was going to Normandy and that the Ger-
man officer he was to contact would be found either in Caen or
St.-Pierre-sur-Dives.  He just didn't know why.  As he walked up
the drive, he told himself that there was no sense speculating
about it because that was what they were going to tell him.  Imme-
diately after this meeting, he was to leave for an air field some-
where near the Channel coast.

He tried not to think about how afraid he was.  He had French
clothes and two sets of French papers, both of which said he was
Alsatian because of the German accent with which he spoke French.
There had been training for his French papers as well, but the main
thrust had been what he thought of as his Pietr Jaeger training.
The uniform had been tailor made and, obviously, there would be a
set of Pietr Jaeger papers waiting for him at the air field.  There
had to be a great many papers.  Numerous pictures had been taken,
head and shoulder shots, full face and profile, with and without
the peaked officer's cap.

During the final days of his tank training, a small, bald Bel-
gian with a tape measure around his neck had come to make the final
fitting for his uniforms.  The little man had nodded and made
satisfied noises as he walked around him slowly on slippered feet.
"Excellent."

Then Peter had put on the peaked officer's cap and turned
abruptly, so he could see himself in the mirror as he would have if
he had run into himself coming around a corner.  That sight had
sobered him as nothing else had.  It made him realize that though
he had taken his training seriously and worked hard at it, it had
simply been nearly nine weeks of "Let's Pretend."  It felt it was
probably better that way.  If it had been that real to him before,
the weight of it would have been too much to bear.  He could only
wonder how the two Jews had stood it.

As he started up the broad front stairs, the front door was
opened by a short square sergeant major with a handlebar moustache.
As the man ushered him through the entry and down the hall to the
library, their footsteps echoed off the bare floor and the equally
bare walls.

The sergeant major tapped on the library door.  Peter heard a
faint "Come."  He stood there, palms sweating, as the still silent
sergeant major opened the door and stood aside so he could enter.

Peter stiffened and marched through the door, blinking at the
sudden burst of sun light after the gloom of the hall.

There was only one man in the room.  He was sitting behind the
desk, looking at Peter expectantly.  He was a slim, elegant-looking
man with graying black hair who was dressed in the tweeds of an
English country squire.  Though Peter was sure he had never seen
him before, the man looked oddly familiar.

"Sir," he said.

The man rose and came out from behind the desk.  "I'm pleased
to meet you at last."  He put out his hand.  Peter took it and they
shook hands briefly.

"My name is Michael Compton."

Peter was stunned to silence.  He stared at Michael Compton,
studying his face, the breadth of it, the smile lines radiating
from the dark set wide eyes, the thick hair that was just beginning
to recede.  "You look just like the picture my parents have of you
with Aunt Anne."

He gave a sharp nod of acknowledgment then said, "I'm sure
you're wondering why I'm here."

"Yes, sir," Peter said.

"The Germans know, so I don't see why you shouldn't.  I'm an
MI6 section chief."

"It was you who brought me here."  A bubble of panic rose in
his throat.

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because you are going to Caen to see your cousin John."

Peter heard the words but it took him a moment to make sense
of them.

"Please sit down, Captain Harris," Michael sat in a green
leather wing chair on one side of the fireplace and gestured toward
the companion chair on the other side.  Peter sat, but only on the
edge of the chair.

"I don't like this," he said.

"Are you saying you won't go?"  Michael Compton asked.  Peter
heard no anxiety in the question.

"Not necessarily. I'm just saying that I don't like it.  John
made his choice in 1937.  It didn't make any sense then.  It
doesn't make any sense now.  But it is the choice he made.  Once he
commits himself, he doesn't change his mind and he would resent
anyone trying to change it for him."

"You know him well."

"Very.  Or I should say I did know him.  I'm not sure who he
is now."  He hesitated.  "Does Aunt Anne know about this?"

"Of course not."

"A security issue, I'm sure."  It was obvious to Peter that
Michael Compton was struggling to control himself but at the moment
he didn't care.  He was being used and so was John.

"Aren't you the least bit curious to know why we want you to
see him?"

"I know why.  Pre-invasion intelligence.  You need to know
everything you can about the military situation all along the
coast.  Fortifications, what units are assigned there.  Caen is on
the coast.  What I don't know is how you can possibly think he
would give you any of that."

"You are going because I have reason to think that he is part
of an officer's plot to kill Adolf Hitler.  We have heard rumors
about such a group for years.  Have even had contact with various
men who have claimed to be part of it.  It's only recently that we
have begun to take them seriously.

"Yes, we would be more than pleased with any intelligence he
would care to send us, and Emlyn Rhys will give you the drill about
how he could get information to us on a regular basis.  I agree
with you.  I don't think he would do that.  But if he were disen-
chanted enough ..."  Michael Compton shrugged. "We need to be pre-
pared.  But the main thing is the plot.  If he is involved, we want
to know how far it goes and how soon we can expect action.

"You're right.  There will be an invasion.  Just where that
will be is still under consideration.  But if they were to succeed
before we had to invade" - He looked at Peter hard. - "you and I
both know that thousands if not hundreds of thousands of lives
would be saved.

"As for the reason you in particular were chosen for this mis-
sion.  It's because you are one of the very few people he might
trust enough to tell.

"I have some other business I need to tend to while I'm here.
It will take about half an hour.  In the meantime, there is a file
I want you to look at."  Michael Compton rose, picked up a manila
folder from the desk and handed it to Peter.  "When you've fin-
ished, please put it back on the desk where you will see a magazine
which may interest you."

After Michael left, Peter sat in silence contemplating the
folder.  He was in the land of "Let's Pretend" again and he didn't
want to come back.

But finally, slowly, he opened it and found some German news-
paper clippings.  The top one was small, a notice that 2nd Lieute-
nant Johann Richter had received the Knight's Cross for actions in
Poland and had been promoted to captain.  The next was a Red Cross
telegram which had been sent to John's mother in May of 1940, say-
ing that he had been wounded in France and was expected to recover
fully.  Another announcement from a German paper: the marriage, in
Hamburg, of Annaliese Scheuermann and Captain Johann Richter.
Peter grunted in surprise.  But what he saw next, the last clipping
in the file, took his breath away.  Captain Johann Richter hailed
as a conquering hero.  Though badly wounded, he had led a group of
six men in a daring cross-Channel escape from England.  It said
nothing about how he had come to be in England, only that he had
been a prisoner of war there, and that he had escaped.

That made no sense to Peter.  If John had been wounded in
France in 1940, he would have been in France until after the
British had been evacuated.  So how, he asked himself, could he
ever have become a prisoner of the British?  And why hadn't Aunt
Anne let them know?  She had written nothing about John after he
joined the Wehrmacht, except for the letter she had written Peter
the summer of 1937, asking if he knew why John had done that.  He
and John had just spent five weeks together and he had been home
only a month when the letter came. "He left you in Paris, Peter,
and instead of coming home, he went back to Berlin and enlisted in
the Wehrmacht.  Can you tell me why?"

There was very little he could tell her.  He and John had
spent four weeks walking and laughing and drinking their way across
the deep forests and steep valleys of the Ardennes followed by a
remarkable week in Paris.  "I see now," he had written her, "that
John was guarded in what he said about Germany, except once, when
he had had too much to drink.  He talked about how hard it was to
study in Munich that last year.  He said he would have gotten a
better education in England.  They were burning books and all the
best professors were gone, because they were Jewish.  He was
appalled by what was happening to the Jews and frightened by the
hatred he saw everywhere.  He said the whole world should be
frightened by it.  But John had gone straight from saying those
things into the Wehrmacht, to help Germany increase its scope for
venting those hatreds.  As he told Michael Compton, it had made no
sense then, it made no sense now.

John had fought well for Germany.  That did make sense to him.
John had always been tough and he had great staying power.  Though
he was small as a boy, he never asked for quarter and he had been
terribly insulted the one time Peter stepped into a fight to help
him, even though he was losing.

In her letters to his parents, Aunt Anne had told them nothing
of what was happening to John during the war.  It was as if, when
John had gone into the Wehrmacht, he had dropped off the face of
the earth.

He sat there, with a kaleidoscope of pictures running through
his brain: the two of them in the Ardennes, John laughing wildly as
Peter fell into a creek; John moving through with the stream of
liquid clay that ran down the steep cliffs above the Harris summer
home on Lake Erie, making the sort of mess of himself that only an
8 year old boy could;  John, his face red and twisted with anger,
yelling at his brother James; the way he rode bareback, clinging to
the horse like a limpet; all the John's, child and man, laughing,
angry, crying, sad, exhausted.  The race of pictures stopped on one
picture, an ecstatic John, in Prussia.  He knew it had to be the
summer when he was thirteen and John was twelve.  They were playing
cricket because James had decided he was going to be the best
player in his school.  Karl von der Greif was there, too.  Peter
gave a little shiver at the memory.  Karl von der Greif was a for-
midable man.

As it was getting dark, when they were all tired and aching a
little and wanting to go to bed but not wanting to admit it, John
had hit one last ball way off, into the woods.  There was wonder on
John's face as he watched it go.  They all raced into the woods to
find it, scuffling, laughing, each of them wanting to be the one
who came up with it.  It was John and the glee on his face was
indescribable.

Anguish drove him out of the chair. The folder flew from his
lap, scattering the clippings all over the floor.

He looked down at the desk and found himself face to face with
the stern-faced Hero of Stalingrad.  Fear quivered in his belly.

That night Peter was lying on his back on a narrow cot in a
small bare room in a Nissen hut on an RAF air base near England's
southern coast listening as torrents of rain fell onto the roof.
He wasn't sure just where he was because, for reasons of security,
he hadn't been told the name of the base.  It didn't matter.  He
knew all he needed to know; that from this place he would fly into
France on the first clear night while the moon was still in the
right phase and that when he got there he was going to have to see
his cousin John. He didn't want to think about any of it.

So he lay there, trying to concentrate on the storm, trying to
remember other times and other storms. But all he could hear was
Michael Compton's words ringing through his brain.  "You are going
to Normandy to see your cousin John.   Your cousin John.  Your
cousin John,"  His mind's eye betrayed him as well, showing, in
rapid motion, still shots John's face, John with the Fuehrer, John
the Hero of Stalingrad.  "I have reason to think he is part of an
officer's plot to kill Adolf Hitler." That was the only thing
Michael Compton had said that made sense to Peter.  It was just the
sort of romantic, wildly dangerous thing John would do if he were
disillusioned enough.

"Where is his wife?" Peter had asked when Michael Compton came
back.

"She died in a bombing raid."  Then Michael Compton had gone
on as if what he had said was nothing, "Before you leave, you will
be given a letter and a mystery novel, both written in German.  You
will take the letter out of the envelope it's in and put it in your
German pay book.  The letter is properly creased and stained, as if
someone has been carrying it with him and reading it for a long
time.  Read it.  It's a love letter, just the sort a man would be
loathe to part with.  It will not incriminate either you or John.
You are to give him the letter and the book.  Tell him it is from
me and that you need a reply within 48 hours.  I feel sure he'll
know what to do with it.   We played played at codes, he and I,
when he was a boy."

"If he refuses to take it?"

"Then you will destroy the letter and go back to the Resis-
tance at once.  You can keep the book.  It's actually rather amus-
ing, if you like that sort of thing."

"And if he turns me in?"

Michael just sat there and looked at him so steadily that
Peter had to look away.  "I have come here to give you your final
instructions myself..."  Michael began slowly.  "... so that no
matter what happens, you will be able to tell the truth."

Peter gave a nervous little laugh.

"I mean it," Michael snapped.  "I want you, if you are cap-
tured, to be able to tell them the absolute truth when you think it
will do you the most good.  You are to tell them that I was the one
who sent you to see your cousin John.  That I wished you to suborn
your cousin.  They know all about me and my relationship to John,
so it will make sense to them."

"And if I'm not captured?  If he turns me in?" Peter per-
sisted.

"The same applies."

Now, in the darkness of the night, lying on a cot, with the
rain pounding on the roof, he felt pain and fear and rage at what
was happening all over again.  He had not been chosen, he was being
used.  And so was John.

Two nights later he was looking out over the side of the
plane, watching as the deep gray corduroy flatness of the Channel
gave way abruptly to the utter black of an irregular shore line
that stretched endlessly in both directions.  It was the coast of
France.

The enormity of what he was doing hit him full force.  He
leaned his head back against the seat and concentrated on taking
long easy breaths.  John's face on the cover of Signal flashed
before his mind's eye, then dissolved into SS runes winking in the
light.  He willed himself to relax, to let the drone of the
Lysander's engine hypnotize him.  The plane reminded him of a model
he had built a long time ago, but instead of tissue paper, the
Lysander was covered with fabric and its wooden frame was of some-
thing far more substantial than balsa and instead of a big fat rub-
ber band that he wound tight to make it fly, this plane had an
engine.  It was a real live engine, he told himself with a smile.
It made noise and everything.  Then the smile faded as he wondered
again at anyone having enough guts to to fly a plane like this over
enemy territory, even in the middle of the night.  And he wondered,
too, how the pilot could possibly find the one very small place he
needed to find in all this vastness.

"... lights!"

Peter leaned forward and yelled "What?" against the engine's
roar.

"Watch for the lights."

"Right."  The L shape of lights they had told him about at the
briefing.

"Just beyond the river!"

He looked down over the side again, eyes straining through the
darkness, trying to find something that looked like a river.
Finally he saw a faint thread of silver that had to be water
reflecting moon light.

He searched but didn't see the lights until the plane was
banking into a rapid descent toward them.  They made an L-shape,
just as they were supposed to, off to starboard.  The plane would
land along the inside length of that L, starting at the top and
heading toward the base, so they would be landing into the wind.

The plane banked again, then dropped with a stomach-lurching
swiftness.  It hit him all over again that this was France, but not
the France of castles and wine and cathedrals and beautiful women.
It was Germany's France.

His heart seemed to constrict as the plane touched down and
bumped along the row of lights.  Then it turned, taxied back and
turned again, ready to take off even as the lights were extin-
guished and dim shapes rushed the plane.

"Vite! Vite!" a voice croaked at him and despite everything it
was a shock to hear French.  But he did hurry,  handing out every-
thing that had been packed in behind him, - packages, a heavy case,
a suitcase, his own duffel bag - all as fast as he could until
there was nothing left. Then he lifted himself up to sit on the
edge, put his feet over and slid down the side. His feet thudded
onto French "soil.  Anxious hands plucked at his sleeve - "Vite!" -
then tugged him away as two shadows brushed past, heading toward
the plane.

"Vite!"  A hand pushed at his back but he stood firm.  He
wanted his duffel bag and said so, in French.  "There," the man
said and he was pushed forward.  He moved fast until he caught up
with a short slight figure which was bowed under the weight of it.

"I'll take that."  He tried to lift it, but there was resis-
tance and he was startled to hear a very angry female voice saying,
"No!" The plane's engines revved and it roared off into the night.
"Yes," he said and tugged again.

She didn't let go.

The woods closed in around them and his toe caught on a tree
root.  He let go as he overbalanced and would have fallen if he
hadn't careened into a tree trunk.

"Since you want it so much..."  She sounded amused.  "Here it
is."

He struggled to his feet and swung the bag up onto his shoul-
der.

"Follow me."  Her hand found his - It was rough, warm

and fine boned.  - and guided it to her shoulder which was
level with the middle of his chest.  It took continuing effort to
moderate the length of his stride to hers, but even so, it did make
the going easier, until she stopped so abruptly that he ran into
her.

"Sorry," he muttered but there was no acknowledgment, only

incomprehensible whispering up ahead and then they were moving
again.  Two heavily laden men veered off to the left and a few
steps later two more went off to the right, leaving four including
Peter.

It was a relief to come out of the trees and into the open.

They moved fast along the line of a hedge then through a nar-
row gap.  He was ordered, "Down!" in a frantic whisper.

Peter rolled the duffel bag off his shoulder and dropped
behind it. He would have been grateful for the breather if he
hadn't heard the sound of engines.

A line of black-out headlights swept around a distant corner
showing that the road was only a narrow sunken country lane.

The column slowed as it came and the staff car in the lead
stopped almost in front of them.  He buried himself behind his duf-
fel bag as one metal door slammed, then another and another.  There

were voices as well, coming nearer as boots crunched on
gravel.  He squeezed his eyes shut - as if that would help -  and
buried his face deep into the crook of his elbow.

"... Flugzeug." Peter's heart started hammering even as his
brain switched to German.

"How many planes?"

"One."

"Where did it come down?"

"Sector E-4."  Mutterings.

He risked lifting his head just enough to let one eye see the
dim light of the black-out flashlight through the brush.  Three

men were huddled over what had to be a map lying on the hood
of the staff car.

"You stay at this crossroads.  Set up a road block.  We'll go
on to the next one ...  here.  They've got Fassler's group on the
St. Lo road, so if they're headed this way..."  The flashlight had
flicked off and the voices were fading as the men moved away.

More boots crunched on gravel, vehicle doors slammed, engines
revved and then the column moved on, leaving one vehicle and at
least three vague shadows on the paler dark of the lane.  There was
a curse, then the flare of a match which after a moment arced into
oblivion leaving only a pin-point orange glow about five and a half
feet above the ground.  It moved toward Peter, bobbing slightly in
rhythm to the sound of booted feet.

Peter's hand twitched toward his knife.

"Put that cigarette out."  A German voice commanded. "And no
more until we're relieved."

The boot sounds moved away from them again, toward what had to
be the crossroads.  Peter's hand relaxed, only to tighten around
the knife hilt again as he felt movement at his side.  That same
man's voice was in his ear again and this time it sounded angry.
"Follow the girl.  The boy will be behind you. Stay low, be quiet
and do as you're told."  With that he was gone.

They inched away from the road and back through two hedge rows
before turning in a new direction. They moved on steadily, through
more hedges, across small fields, through orchards - the trees
heavy with late apples - through a creek and finally, in a heart-
stopping rush, they crossed a road, and tore through a hedge on the
other side.  There was just time to drop to the ground behind it
before another vehicle appeared.  It was a German staff car racing
down the road, headlights ablaze against all rules and sense.

Water from the creek had soaked through Peter's boots and his
clothes were sweat-stuck to his back.  It was a fast forced march
now and he couldn't imagine how the girl was managing to keep up.
But she was.  She was just ahead of him, moving steadily, appar-
ently

comfortable with the pace despite the back-pack she had picked
up somewhere along the way.

He was concentrating so hard on keeping his footing in what
had to be a farm field that it came as a shock to hear the sharp
command that stopped him almost within touching distance of what
had to be long wall.

He stood waiting, ready to move, not liking the fact that he
was in the open with a wall that was too high to jump in front of
him.

"Move."  The approach had been so silent that the quiet voice
was a shock.  "Hurry!" It was a boy's voice.  "Father says there
are patrols everywhere tonight!"

They went through a small door in the wall.  Judging from the
smell and the animal noises coming from his left, he was in a farm
compound. They crossed an open gravel courtyard and went straight
into a building.  He heard the scuffling of feet on a wooden floor
and the scrape of metal on metal. Then there was a sharp scratch
and the brief flare of a match that lit a lamp and left Peter
squinting.

When he could see again, he thought there had to be something

wrong.  There was an apparition in front of him, a man so
twisted and grotesque that he couldn't be real.

But then the apparition smiled and said, "Welcome," and incre-
dibly enough that Bella Lugosi face dissolved into an expression of
surpassing sweetness.  "You may call me Louis." He put out a hand
and Peter shook it firmly, saying simply, "Peter" in return.

"This is my son Bernard."  The old man gestured to the boy
beside him.

Peter nodded and put out his hand.  It was taken at once.  The
boy was tall and slim with a shock of black hair that obscured his
forehead and half covered his eyes.  Peter wondered how old he was.
Surely no more than 15.

"And my daughter Sylvie."

Even in the shadows, or perhaps because of them, she was
lovely. She had pulled off a sailor's watch cap and was shaking out
a full head of black hair that settled around her face.  Only then
did she give him a quick nod and put out her hand.

He had barely taken it before she pulled it away and turned to
her father.  "How is Brigitte?"

"Asleep, as any four year old should be at this hour.  She
didn't even hear you go out."

"Good.  Where is Jacques?"

"Inside, seeing what this gentleman has brought with him."

She gave another nod and disappeared.

"Your boots, Peter," Louis said. "Quickly please.  Bernard
will clean them so they won't be ruined.  We've no replacements."

"I can do it myself."

"There's no time for that.  You're filthy and you must bathe
before we hide you.  The water is already heated.  But hurry," he
urged again.  "The Germans have patrols out."

Peter hurried.

It was a large house, obviously the home of a prosperous and
cultured landowner.  The downstairs rooms were big and included a

library with floor to ceiling shelves stuffed with books with
worn leather bindings. The furniture was oversized, the sofas and
arm chairs upholstered in heavy brocade, the tables and chests were
stained dark and ornately carved.  The floors both upstairs and
down, were covered with oriental rugs of venerable age.

It was all beautifully cared for.  The exposed stone of the
floor was polished to a sheen as was the heavy old furniture. But
the upholstery was shabby, the curtains were faded, and everything
looked outdated, as if time here had stopped a long time ago.

It was a typical Norman manor house, in that it formed part of
the wall around the farm enclosure.  It had a black roof and, like
the wall, was constructed of gray stone.  There was a turret at the
only outside corner.  It had been built and rebuilt and added onto
through the ages, leaving a small windowless room in limbo, with no
access except through the false back of an ancient armoire in the
guest bedroom.  There was also a secret tunnel running from the
cellar out into the orchard.   It was in that tunnel that Jacques
had stored the supplies.

Peter was hustled off to the upstairs bathroom, literally a
bath room since the only things in it were a long wood-encased zinc
bathtub and the old coal-fired hot water heater that fed it.  He
was hurrying.  Germans aside, there was no temptation to linger in
the 2 inches of barely lukewarm water he had been allowed.

Even so he had just pulled the plug when he heard frantic
banging on the bathroom door.  He wrapped his towel around his
waist and tore open the door to find the boy standing there pulling
on his nightshirt. His head appeared with his damp hair standing in
spikes.

"Quick!"  A finger pointed toward the end of the hall.  "Syl-
vie will show you.  I'll tend to your clothes and dry out the tub.
Father was watching in the tower. A patrol's headed this way."

He went.  The girl was in the room, struggling with something
inside an enormous antique armoire.

She must have heard him because she backed out.  "The panel."
Her face was flushed and she was breathing hard.  "It's stuck.  I
should have had your bag inside already but..."

He pushed her aside.

"It slides sideways, toward the window."

He reached in and felt around, found the inch it was open,
pushed in his fingers and heaved.  Nothing.  He tried again, lift-
ing the end of the panel slightly as he tried to ease it along. It
didn't budge. He tried once more,  this time pushing in slightly,
but it still didn't move.

As he backed out, the towel dropped but he had no time or
thought for that.  He opened his duffel bag.  "Quick," he urged as
he hauled out what was on top, then felt for the field gray under-
wear that should be right underneath. "Get out of your clothes and
into the bed."  There was no sound, no movement. He looked up and
saw her staring at him.

"Get into the bed!" he snapped.  "And mess it up, as if we've

been..."  He shrugged and started hauling on the underwear,
only then realizing that he was naked.

But there was no time for nakedness because a truck was

pulling into the yard. His hand searched in the bag again and
came out with the smallish flat box that held his German identity
disc and wallet, complete with papers and ration book.

"Unpack everything while I go.  Clothes in the armoire.  You
know.  As if I'm staying here.  I'm afraid they have to think we've
been ..." He was struggling with the fly buttons on his uniform
trousers.

"I know what they have to think."  She just sat there, watch-
ing him.

Then the front door crashed open and she was galvanized into
action.  Peter pulled on his uniform jacket and shoved the pay book
into the inside pocket.  grabbed a shirt and pulled it on as he
went.

"What's all this about?" The old man sounded indignant as well
as frightened.  "We're respectable law-abiding people!"

"An enemy plane landed in this sector then took off again."
The soldier's French was so heavily accented that it was almost
incomprehensible.  "We're looking for who and what they left
behind."

Peter's hands were shaking so hard that he couldn't have but-
toned the jacket if there had been time.  Just as he started down
the stairs, two German soldiers started up at a run.

"Stop right there," he ordered in his harsh Prussian German,
and moved to block the way.

If he had planned it, he couldn't have managed the situation
or used his size to better advantage.  Not only was he a total sur-
prise, but he was towering over them and his candle-lit shadow com-
manded the entry way.

Everyone stopped.  The men on the stairs gaped up at him then
looked back uncertainly toward the only soldier standing in the
hall below, the man who had to be in charge. That man reached over
and snapped on the lights despite the fact that the door was still
hanging open.

"Shut the door, you idiot," Peter snapped.

The man, a sergeant, stood looking up at him with a curiously
sardonic expression while Louis stared, his oversized jaw agape.

It was a moment before the sergeant collected himself and ges-
tured impatiently for the old man to shut the door.  Then he stood
at a semblance of attention, just looking at Peter.

There was the sound of crockery  crashing in the kitchen.
Peter brushed by the two men of the stairs as if they weren't
there. "Stop those men from tearing things apart.  This has proven
to be"

- He managed a convincing smirk as he reached the bottom of
the stairs. - "a very friendly house."  Then his face hardened.
"So if one more thing is broken or damaged or if anything is sto-
len, your commanding officer will hear about it in the morning."

There was no doubt in the sergeant's mind that he was facing a
German officer, but he had his orders and orders were orders.  "I
need to see your papers, sir."

Peter hauled out his pay book and slapped it into the out-
stretched hand.  His heart was pounding and he clasped his hands
behind his back to hide their shaking.

The sergeant riffled through the pages, then turned back to
the front page, studying it carefully.  Then he handed it back.
"Can you personally vouch for the fact that this old man" - He dis-
missed Louis with an impatient gesture - "and everyone else in this
house has been here all night and that no one else has either come
in or gone out?"

"No one came and no one left.  We have been here, undisturbed,
all night."

There was a faint sound and they all looked up, the soldiers

with their rifles at the ready.  Sylvie was standing at the
top of the stairs in her nightgown and robe, her hair a wonderful
dishevelment.  She was holding a blonde, curly headed child who
was rubbing sleep from her eyes.

"I told you I'd look after this, Sylvie," Peter said in his
German-accented French.  "Go back to bed."

She turned and disappeared.

"And I assume, Herr Lieutenant, that you intend to be undis-
turbed here for the rest of this night?"

"This night and as many nights as possible."

"You have impeccable taste."  The tone was sardonic.  It was
obvious that the sergeant was a veteran.  He was world-weary and
totally unintimidated by any officer.

He looked around.  "All right, men.  Let's go."  He sounded
tired suddenly. "There's nothing here."

He ushered his men out the door, then paused and turned back.

"I'd salute you, Herr Lieutenant, but you don't have your cap
on."

Before Peter could think of a reply to such insolence, the man
was closing the door after himself with exaggerated care.

Louis collapsed against the wall and wiped his forehead on the
sleeve of his worn brocade robe as Sylvie came running down the
long stair case toward him.  Her brother's frightened voice fol-
lowed her.  "Are they really gone?"

"Yes, Bernard," Louis said as put his arm around his daughter
and pulled her to him. "They really have gone.  Come down.  We all
need some of that brandy Sylvie promised us earlier."

The boy bounded down the stairs as the sound of engines faded
into the night.

"Bring the brandy and the glasses into the library, Sylvie,"
her father insisted gently as he released her.

She went without so much as a glance in Peter's direction.

"I'm sorry," Peter said after her, then looked at her father
helplessly.  "I really am.  It was the only thing I could think of.
The panel in the armoire was stuck and there didn't seem to be any
other way to handle it. But I genuinely regret the damage it will
cause to her reputation.  With the child.  And her husband..."
Louis gave the ubiquitous and very expressive Gallic shrug which,
this time, indicated acceptance of the unacceptable as inevitable.
But then he softened it with a sad smile.  "I never thought I would
be relieved to see my daughter's honor impugned, especially in my
own home, but I must confess..." Then he shrugged again, but more
gently this time.  "What you did showed great presence of mind.
You saved us all, including yourself.  I am grateful.  As for her
husband, he was killed fighting the Germans, in 1940."

Louis Laurence picked up the candlestick, turned out the hall
light and led the way into the library.
