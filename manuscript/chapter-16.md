# Chapter 16
In the Cafe Ardiet, a crush was developing in the hallway that
led to the cellar.
"There's plenty of room.  No need to push,"  Guy Ardiet was
saying.  "Everything is ready downstairs.  The ceiling is heavily
reinforced for your protection.  There are candles under the
benches along the walls and in the corners in case we lose power.
And there's a bar and music for your pleasure." He urged one on
here, placed a restraining hand on another there, and, for the
moment, order was restored.
They were all afraid, some less so because after the first few
raids they knew what to expect, others more so because they also
knew what to expect.  Hans Richter was one of those.  He was barely
aware of Madeleine's hand in his or the occasional elbow followed
by a muttered, "Sorry."  He approached that cellar with increasing
dread.  There had been too many pain-filled days in a dank, stink-
ing cellar when he was in and out of consciousness as shells fell
around him and the wounded tried to stifle their moans and die with
dignity.  He told himself over and over that it wouldn't be like
that here, that here there would be light and food and people to
talk to.  But there had been lights and people the night the bombs
fell on Annaliese and that hadn't helped.  Sitting out a raid in a
cellar took a sort of patient courage, the ability to stand fast
and endure that he wasn't sure he had any more.
There were the dull serial booms of bombs falling in the dis-
tance and people began pushing in earnest.
As they neared the doorway to the cellar, Hans was shoved
against the wall.  He pulled Madeleine to him and spread his legs,
locking his knees so he could hold them both erect.
The two Gestapo men from the bar bulled their way through with
a pneumatic blond sandwiched between them. The major, whose way
they were clearing, followed close in their wake as if it were his
right.
The crowd surged in behind to refill the vacuum, crushing them
back against the wall.  Suddenly a broad back covered with field
gray was in front of him.  The pressure eased.  It was Peter.  He
was holding the woman to him with one arm and redirecting the
stream simply by standing fast.
"Move, Madeleine."  Hans said.  They sidled along the wall the
few feet to the doorway.
"Thank you," Hans said over his shoulder.
The only reply was a clearing of the throat.
He moved to the top step, aware that Peter was continuing to
keep the crowd from closing in on them.
"Ladies and gentlemen."  Guy's voice had risen to a command-
ing roar.  "Don't push.  There's penty of room downstairs and
plenty of time, if you don't push."
Hans and Madeleine got to the bottom of the stairs.  He
grabbed her hand and pulled her off into the crowd, looking back to
see a clot of people on the stairs with Peter at the head.  Peter
gathered up the girl and, using the support beam at the bottom of
the stairs swung her around, away from the crowd, right into Georg
Brandt.
"A veritable party," said the Gestapo major who was now
directly ahead of Hans.
A young barman appeared and led the major off through a haze
of cigarette smoke toward what had to be considered a more favor-
able location.  "How quaint," the supercilious voice was saying as
it faded into the din made of loud talk compounded by the faint
tinkling of a piano.   A tall reedy looking SS officer followed.
Hans assumed it was Fritz Heiligmann since a grim faced Erich von
Feber was just behind him.  Von Feber saw him and rolled his eyes
before disappearing into the crowd.
"Something to drink?" There was a sheen of sweat on the
waiter's face and the tray trembled in his hand.
"Yes," Hans said.  "Two brandies and we'll be over there." He
pointed to the far corner along the front wall.  As he led Made-
leine in that direction, he kept turning back.  He could see
Peter's head over the crowd.  He was making his way to the narrower
wall at the front, between Madeleine and him and the stairs.

The shelter was a large room, occupying the total width and
more than half the length of the building.  The ceiling had been
reinforced by heavy beams which ran crosswise to those holding up
the main floor.  These were supported by heavier vertical beams set
into the hard packed earth floor.  In turn, the vertical beams were
braced by other beams which met them at an angle.
Peter was not reassured.  He knew those beams would be nothing
against a direct hit.  They would help only if a near miss made the
building shake.  He had made a careful choice.  If the building did
fall in, it was safer in a corner or against the narrower wall.
Since John was already in the corner with the chanteuse, the narrow
wall was the choice.
But the walls didn't inspire confidence either.  They were
rough stone with mortar crumbling out in some places, absent all
together in others. There was a loud boom.  Peter grabbed Sylvie
and put her between himself and the wall, shielding her with him-
self as the whole building shook.  Naked light bulbs danced on the
end of their black cords and legions of dust motes glittered and
swayed as they sank slowly into the rising haze of smoke.  Then,
slowly, everything settled back, almost where it had been.
There was a moment of silence in the aftermath, finally broken
by a few whimpers and sobs that couldn't be drowned out by the
determined efforts of the piano player.
He stood away from her and saw that her drink had spilled down
her dress.  "I'm sorry."
"For what."  She was looking up at him.  Her face was bleached
white and she was trembling.
He gestured toward her dress.
She shrugged.  "If that's all that happens tonight ...  I've
never been in anything like this.  We live in the country.   How
long will it last?"
"I've been shelled.  Out in the opened.  Never bombed like
this, so I don't know."
"This must be worse," she said and sipped at what was left of
her drink.  "We're trapped and there's no way to fight back."
"Mmmmm," he said, sipping his own drink and glancing toward
the corner where Hans and the woman were sitting on a bench, deep
in converstion.  It was obvious that there was something between
them and that was a surprise to Peter.  Hans had been sensitive
about his size growing up and had always preferred girls who were
small and fine boned.  This one was scarcely that.
He looked down at Sylvie and found her regarding him soberly.
"You are tense," she said.  "And it is not the tension that comes
in a man when he looks at a beautiful woman."  He started to open
his mouth but she put a gentle finger to his lips.  "Therefore it
is not the beautiful woman who concerns you.  Upstairs, as we were
coming down ...   You had no reason to stop the crowd for the colo-
nel.  He would have gotten down here eventually.  But you did it
all the same.  I saw him in the dining room, because you were look-
ing at him as he came back across the room.  When he sat down, he
saw you.  There was something in the way he looked at you but it
was gone so quickly.  And when we got down the stairs, you liter-
ally ran into a major.  He was startled.  There was something about
the way he was startled that told me that he knew you and that he
wasn't glad to see you here.  These men know you, Peter.  I think
one or both of them is who you came to see."
He just looked at her.
"I don't know who they are," she said, "and I will not try to
find out. And when you go out to meet one of them at the church,
I will not follow."
Peter said nothing because Georg and a major with only one arm
had just come out of the crowd and were standing close by, between
him and Hans.  Though they were talking to each other in quiet
tones and seemingly paying no attention to him, Peter knew from the
set of his back, that Georg knew precisely where he was, that he
would hear everything that was said and that he wouldn't let him
get any closer to John than he already was.
Sylvie was watching Georg as well.  She reached up and pulled
Peter's heead down to hers, speaking directly into his ear.  "This
one is angry with you. The other one, the colonel, he loves that
woman very much."
"If you're so sure about all of this, tell me, does she love
him?"
"At least as much."

"Are you all right?" Madeleine asked Hans softly.
He just nodded.  He didn't want to tell her that he was having
flash-backs to another cellar, that along with the bombs there were
Peter and the Gestapo and the bizarre contrast of the raucous
forced gaiety all around them.  For him, Gotterdammerung had
arrived.
A cool hand slipped into his, startling him.
"What is it?"  Madeleine asked.
He was grateful for the waiter who had just appeared.  He said
something to Madeleine that Hans couldn't hear as he handed her her
glass.  "No," she said firmly, then shook her head for emphasis.
The waiter didn't even look at Hans as he handed him his
glass.  His eyes were still on Madeleine.  She gave him another
even more emphatic "No."  Only when the waiter had backed off, did
Hans realize he hadn't asked for any money.
"Guy wanted me to sing."  She sipped her brandy.  Her hands
were shaking. "I couldn't possibly.  I don't want to leave you."
Hans tossed down the rest of his brandy and beckoned for the
waiter who put a hand through the crowd that was closing in around
them.  "A double this time," he called over the din and watched for
the man's answering nod before he turned back to her.  "I'm sorry.
I should have asked if you wanted more as well."
She shook her head and lifted her glass to indicate that
it was almost full.
His hand clenched around hers convulsively as the building
went into another spasm.
"Talk to me, please." Her voice was shaking.  "Tell me what's
wrong.  I need to know.  It would help me."
His double brandy arrived and he took it absently.  "Just
another time in another cellar." He drank half of it.  "I was
wounded.  Badly enough so I couldn't move."
"Was that when you got the scar on your leg?"
He nodded and drank again, but just a bit this time.  "The
Russians were shelling us almost continuously by then.  In Stal-
ingrad."  This time he didn't drink at all.
"Major Schuster and Captain Schmidt were there with you?"
His eyes avoided hers as he nodded his agreement.
"If you were in Stalingrad..."  She frowned.  "How did you get
out?  You were surrounded."
Slowly, he did begin to tell her, at least some things and
after a time, without his realizing it, the terrible claustrophobia
eased.
But then there was another wave of bombs and the building
shook again.  Hans put his arm around her and pulled her against
him.
"When will it stop?" she asked in a small voice.
"I wish I knew."
There was a tremendous cracking sound.  He threw Madeleine to
the ground and himself across her as the explosion came.  They were
flung back against the wall then dropped to the floor as the build-
ing shuddered.  The floor heaved and the lights jumped and went out
amid a cacophony of violent crackings and crashes and screams as
the cellar seemed to fall in on itself.
