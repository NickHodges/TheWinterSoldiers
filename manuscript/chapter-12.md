# Chapter 12

It was a brilliant fall day.  The sky was cloudless and the
breeze was warm.  The trees were just beginning to turn color and
the air was so clear that each leaf stood out on every tree.
The broad sandy beaches of Normandy were covered by long coils
of barbed wire and tank traps that were sprouting like weeds run
amok.  But on the grassy cliffs above Arramanche where Hans had
brought Madeleine for a picnic, the beaches were invisible.  They
could look out and see nothing but the deceptively peaceful blue
gray waters of the English Channel.
They were alone, or at least they had the illusion of being
alone.  The gun emplacements on the cliffs were invisible, thanks to
a copse on one side and a wind screen Sergei had rigged on the
other.  Sergei was invisible as well, though he was within hailing
distance.  He was relaxing in the lee of the staff car in a canvas
and wood sling chair, trying to improve his German by reading one of
the classics with the help of his dictionary. It was a novel called
"The Sorrows of Young Werther" which he found slow going.  But he
was also enjoying his own view of the Channel and enjoying, too, not
having to be on constant watch.  They were within the three mile
zone from the coast, a zone no Frenchman could enter without a spe-
cial pass.  Even those who were still allowed to live there had
their movements severely restricted.  It was one of the few places
in France where a man in a German uniform didn't have to be afraid
to walk alone.
Hans and Madeleine had finished an excellent lunch: good wine,
fresh bread, excellent local cheese and a small apple flan.  A ther-
mos of coffee was waiting.
Hans was stretched out on the blanket.  Though his eyes were
closed he wasn't asleep.   He simply didn't want to talk.  His body
was making it appalling clear that he wanted her while his brain
railed at him, telling him that such a thing was unthinkable, that
he shouldn't be here with her, that there was too much to do, that a
woman would only complicate his life.  So why, he asked himself as
he had so many times before, was he doing this?
He didn't like the answer that came. He was here for the same
reason he had been at the cafe four times within the last two weeks,
because he had no choice.  Schmidt was worried about her and, as
tactful as he had tried to be, he did have a point.  She was French
and he was one of France's occupiers.  She was also Guy Ardiet's
cousin and Guy Ardiet was Master Sergeant Kriebel's partner in an
extensive black market operation which meant, as an anguished
Schmidt saw it, that she could be part of Kriebel's information
gathering for the Gestapo.  Hans knew that was possible.  Her whole
"I hate the war" attitude could simply be a ruse to get him to trust
her.  He didn't believe that, but he also didn't totally trust his
disbelief.  But then he asked himself why it should matter whether
or not he trusted her.  He never discussed anything military with
her.  They talked about all sorts of things, but never the war.  She
liked hearing about his life in London and wanted to know about
everything English.  And she wanted to know all about the workings
of Karl's estate in East Prussia. Though life there was very differ-
ent from that on a family farm in Normandy, many of the concerns
were the same.  In turn, she told him about what it was like to grow
up in Normandy, about the big family which had watched over her
after her mother died, about various eccentric relatives including
her Aunt Clothilde who had arranged for her to have the whole second
floor of the house directly behind hers when she moved back to Caen.
It was a different life than he had ever known and she told wonder-
ful stories about everyone that made him laugh.  It was wonderful to
laugh like that.  It made her matter to him.  But he didn't want her
to matter to him. He didn't want anyone or anything to matter, espe-
cially a woman.  Intense feelings were too dangerous.  They had
nearly killed him when Annaliese died and he never, ever wanted to
go through anything like that again.
He opened his eyes.  She was sitting with her hands clasped
around her knees, looking out over the Channel.  She was wearing a
white cotton blouse that was even whiter than her skin and a full
blue cotton skirt which she had tucked modestly around her legs.  A
lovely creature, he thought with a detachment he found reassuring,
especially with her hair stirring in the breeze.  It was a different
loveliness than the glamour of a chanteuse.  Today she was just a
girl, and he liked that very much.   She was wearing sandals and
he found the sight of her feet disturbing.  They were attractive
feet, well shaped, with high arches and an interesting shape.  The
second toe on each foot was longer than the first. He found that
particularly unsettling.
He saw her shiver.
"Cold?"  His voice was thick as if he really had been sleeping.
She shook her head.
"Is something wrong?"
"Why should anything be wrong?"  Her smile was forced.
"Yes, why?" he asked.  "It's a beautiful day in a beautiful
place after a beautiful lunch.  But unfortunately there is also an
ugly war going on."
"Yes," she said and he saw, with surprise, that there were tears
streaming down her face.
She poured the last of the wine into her glass and drank it
down.
He reached into the basket for another bottle but found only
calvados.  He opened it and leaned over enough to pour a little into
her wine glass.
"What's the matter?" he asked again.
She gestured helplessly.  "The war.  Isn't that enough?"
"More than enough."
She looked down into her glass.  "I hate this war."
There was a vehemence in her words that surprised hin.
She smiled an ugly twisted smile. "Because France is under
conquest and you are one of her conquerors?"
He looked away.
"It has nothing to do with you."  Her voice had softened.
He let the silence hang in the air.
"You are ... different," she said. "You have suffered too much
from this war to like the conquest. It's just the war I hate, not
you."
When he looked at her at last, she had turned her profile to him
and was letting the breeze blow the hair back off her face.  "Men
invented war."
She put down her glass and began plucking at the grass.  "Almost
before time began some men decided to take from others what they
couldn't get for themselves.  They fought to get it.  The men they
tried to take it from fought to protect what they had.  They fought
each other until the protectors became angry enough to become takers
themselves, taking from those who tried to take from them.  The
fighting went on, back and forth,  As they ranged farther and far-
ther, other groups joined one side or the other, depending on where
their best interests lay.  As the groups got larger, they were
forced to organize..  Once that happened, the groups could get
larger still, until finally they were so large that they formed
themselves into nations which meant even more intricate organization
was required, with levels of leadership and laws.   Then alliances
were formed between nations and then these alliances were reformedm
again and again, depending on where their best interests lay.
"Once they were nations, their rulers felt they were far too
important to call taking what they were doing taking what they
wanted.  That made them sound as greedy and power hungry as they
were.  So they formalized the fighting, made rules about how it was
to be conducted, and called it war."  She sounded sad.  "War sounds
so much important, don't you think?"  Her eyes filled and she swiped
at them with the back of her hand.  "But it's all so cynical.  Wars
are supposed to resolve conflicts between nations, but there never
is never a resolution, is there, because wars go on and on.
Alliances change but wars go on, because by now war has taken on a
life of its own and too man people have a vested interest in pre-
serving it.
"Armament manufacturers love it.  It makes them fabulously
wealthy.  Generals need it to advance their careers and to making
them famous heroes, and the politicians need it because it unites
the people and makes them forget their real grievances."  Anger
turned to bitterness.  "And for those who actually fight the war,
the average soldier ...  He think war gives him a chance to prove
his worth as a man.
"One of the differences between men and women ...  Men need war.
Women don't.  Women prove their courage in creation, not destruc-
tion." She went back to plucking at the grass beside her.  "They
joyfully take in the seed of a man they love and carry the fruit of
that seed, nurture it, make it grow to life, happy in that creation
even when it is taking a physical toll."  Her voice gathered
strength.  "Then, in the ultimate act of courage, they put them-
selves into the way of pain and danger to deliver that child, to
give it ultimate life.  The joy of that..."
"Stop."
"What is it?"  she asked.
There were slow tears running down his face.   He felt a soft
cloth blotting them up.  He turned his head away but the tears
wouldn't stop.
"Here."  A wine glass was thrust into one hand then a napkin
into the other.
"Drink," she insisted.
He drank, choking a little as the calvados burned down his
throat.  He drank again, this time more cautiously, and wiped his
face with the napkin.
He felt her hand on his back, smoothing it.  He shrugged it off.
"My wife died five days after giving birth to our son."
"I'm sorry," she said. "I didn't know."
"It's not something I talk about.  There was an air raid.  A
bomb."  Words began tumbling out.  They didn't stop until he had
told her everything.
She was behind him now, wrapping herself around him from the
back, holding him.
"My son, Andre was two years old." Her voice sounded as if she
were strangling. "His father and I could not marry.  So when I found
I was pregnant, I went to Paris, to an aunt who wants nothing to do
with the Ardiets.  After a time, after the war started, there was
someone else.  He was involved in the black market.  He tried to
tell me it was part of his work for the Resistance but that wasn't
entirely true.  One day when I was at rehearsal and he was home with
the boy ..."
He tried to shut out her voice.
"He didn't tell me he had to go a meeting.  I don't know whether
it was Resistance or the black market business. It doesn't matter.
He took the boy with him because he thought no one would suspect him
if he was carrying a child.  But something happened and the Gestapo
came.  He left Andre and ran.  The Gestapo was shooting.  The others
shot back.  I keep thinking how terrified Andre must have been." She
was weeping now and barely comprehensible. "A two year old child.
He wandered out, probably crying for me or this man, Pierre.  No one
was paying any attention to him.  He got caught in the middle.  Got
shot, over and over."  She drew in a deep breath and her voice
firmed.  "Pierre just ran.  He never came to me.  Never told me.  I
never saw him again.  It was a man I didn't know who came to tell me
what happened.  I had to go to the morgue and identify my son."
Hans turned and pulled her to him, holding her across his chest
trying to squeeze away the pain.
"I have never told anyone here," she said in a breathless voice
that was muffled by his shirt front.  "My family didn't even know I
was pregnant.  When I went to Paris, they were angry.  But you won't
tell ... about the Resistance, I mean ... Please."
He felt her flutter of fear and his hand stroked down her back.
"No," he said.  "No."   It was as if something exploded in his
chest.  "I love you."
Suddenly they were mouth to mouth, rolling on the blanket,
their hands working frantically, his lifting her skirt, hers fighting
with his belt.  They separated, each breathlessly struggling with
clothing in the awkwardness of great need.  As she turned back to
him he saw the wonderful fullness of breast, the lovely line of
waist and hip, the triangle of black hair.  As he rolled onto the
warmth of her, her legs opened for him and his urgency was so great
that there was no time for anything but thrusting himself into the
wet heat of her.  She moved with him, awkwardly at first, then in a
unison that was overwhelming.
When he started to lift himself away from her, she tightened her
arms around him.
"I'm not too heavy?"
"No."
He hugged her briefly, then lay still trying to hang on to a
moment that seemed to be escaping.  "We can't do this,"  He said
with an odd little laugh.  "Someone may see us."  He was off her
and standing before she could disagree.
"You are beautiful."
She looked up at him and smiled.  "So are you."
He stopped, shirt in hand.  "I wouldn't say so, especially
right now."
Madeleine bent her head to button her blouse.  "You are far too
thin.  I think you must have been very ill not long ago and your
scars ...  They tell me that your body is very strong because it has
survived a great deal.  Besides, you and your body made me very
happy just now.  I haven't felt happy in a long time.  So, to me,
you are beautiful."
"Herr Colonel."  The voice came from somewhere beyond the wind
screen.
As she dropped her skirt over her head, she saw Hans jamming his
shirt tail into his pants.
"What is it, Sergei?"
"It is time."
"Yes.  We'll be right there."  Hans came to her and extended his
hand to help her up.  She smoothed her hair and adjusted her blouse.
When she turned back, the picnic basket was closed and he was fold-
ing the blanket.
"May I see you again?" he asked.
"All of me?"
"Oh, yes."
They were laughing as they came out from behind the screen.
"Schmidt..."  Hans paused as he walked through his outer office
and eyed Schmidt warily.  Schmidt was standing behind his desk at
what would have been attention if he hadn't been swaying slightly.
"I think you had better come into my office."
"I would like to," Schmidt replied.
Hans went in and sat behind his desk.
Schmidt shut the door after himself with exaggerated care, then
came and stood before Hans' desk.
"Would you like to sit down?"
"No.  Thank you."
"Schmidt, are you drunk?"
"You might say that, sir," he said in an owlish, excessively
controlled fashion that was an answer all by itself.
"I've never seen you drunk before."
"No, sir."  Schmidt's eyes weren't focusing well and wherever
they were looking, it never seemed to be at Hans. "You never have."
"Why are you drunk now?"
"Because..." Schmidt had to catch himself with one hand on one
corner of the desk and it was all Hans could do not to laugh.
"It isn't funny." Schmidt said.
"No, it's not," Hans said.  Then he waited, not sure what he was
waiting for, but not liking the signs.
Schmidt dug into his uniform jacket pocket and hauled out an
envelope that looked the worse for such wear.  He put it on the desk
with exaggerated care, face up, so Hans could see what was written
on it.
Hans was not happy.  It was another message from Karl von der
Greif.  He had thought Karl was through with such messages.
"I think you may be using us, sir," Schmidt said, "Using Schus-
ter and me. Schuster doesn't think so.  And even if you were, I
don't think he would care that much.  He says if you're involved
with what I think you're involved in, he will help you if you ask
him.  But I..."  There was a discrete burp.  "Excuse me." He paused
to collect himself  "I am also very angry, sir, because you don't
trust me."
"I have trusted you with my life, Schmidt, more than once."
"And I hope that I have never betrayed that trust, which is why
I am so angry now that you refuse to trust me enough to let me make
a choice."  His forefinger jerked toward the letter.  "If you and
your uncle, the Colonel General, and probably Major Brandt and
Major Wagner and maybe even Captain von Feber ...  If all of you
are together in the plotting I hear rumors about...  If you are
caught, everyone will assume that Schuster and I are involved even
though we're not."
"If it were true that I was involved in some sort of plot..."
Hans had to stop.  He was filled with shame.  It was just as Ulrich
Wagner had said.  He had waited too long.  "You have told me what
Schuster's choice would be if I were involved.  What would yours
be?"
"I have thought about this."
It was almost beyond bearing for Hans to realize that that
thinking had driven Schmidt to near drunken insensibility.
"It would depend on whether you did this because you felt you
were protecting us.  I hadn't thought of that until Schuster said
that might be the reason.  But that is an insult." Schmidt's eyes
were on him steadily at last. "For you to think that we need pro-
tecting is an insult."
"You're right," Hans said. "It is.  But I didn't think of it
that way.  I should have.  I'm sorry.  You are more than able to
take care of yourselves, provided you have the facts."
Schmidt's eyes narrowed and then his face screwed up with the
effort of turning his thinking to accommodate this turn of events.
"Yes."  He nodded.  "I can take care of myself."  More thinking.
"If I have the facts." He nodded again.  "But that insult ...  I
can accept that that is what you might have done, not thinking of
it that way.  But it's the trust, you see.  Do you see?"
"Yes."
"If you trusted me, my answer would be one thing.  You did ask
me what my choice would be if what I think is true is really true?"
"Yes.  I asked you that."
"If you trusted me it might be one thing.  If you didn't, it
might be another."
"I have trusted you from the beginning." That was true.  Even
though he didn't give trust easily, Hans had always given it to
both Schmidt and Schuster - except in this one instance - and that
trust had never been misplaced.  "What I did, I did largely from a
misguided sense that I was protecting you."
"You are going to tell me now?  What's going on?  So that I
have a choice?"
"If you want me to."
Schmidt's eyes were wandering again, each in its own direc-
tion and his legs were shaking but he made the great effort it took
both to concentrate and to stay on his feet.
"That is the heart of it.  Do I want to know?"  He spoke as if
he were talking to himself.   "What I know, I know.  What I sus-
pect, I only suspect.  If you tell me, I will really know and there
is no denying it.  So is it better just to suspect than to really
know?  Or is it better to know?  I don't know.  The only thing I do
know is that I don't like trying to think about it."
Hans waited.
"I ... want ... to ... know."  With that he crumpled into a
heap on the floor.
Hans bellowed for Sergei as he rushed around the desk.
"Are you all right?"  Hans asked Schmidt frantically as he knelt
beside him.
Schmidt's eyes were open and he was trying to focus on Hans.
"...  know," he said. The word was more a movement of lips than a
sound.
"In the morning."
The door burst open.
"I'll tell you all I can in the morning."
Schmidt's eyes closed mid-nod.
"He is ill?" Sergei asked anxiously.
Hans hunkered back, his eyes still on Schmidt's face.
Sergei gave a surprised grunt. "He's drunk."
Hans looked up.  His face was bleak.
"I will take him over to his room, colonel.  He should be in
bed.  Please."  He put a hand under Hans' armpit and helped him to
his feet.   "And I will see that he is all right, unless you need
me here."
"Thank you, Sergei.  Stay with him as long as necessary.  I
have some things I need to tend to here, then I'll be along to check
on him.  If I need you meantime, I'll know where to find you."
Mercifully Karl's message to Hans was brief.  It was also sur-
prising.
Call.  Invite me to inspect.
The call took some time to get through. As Hans waited, all he
could think of was Madeleine and was consoled even as he cursed
himself for his consolation.  This was no time for a woman.  With
Annaliese it had been no time for a woman either. Then, as now, it
had simply happened.
The thought both appalled and frightened him.  They were two
very different women, yet in ways they were very much the same and
so was the situation.  As with Annaliese, he had nothing to offer
Madeleine except pain and the strong possibility of eventual dis-
grace.  But at least Madeleine was aware of what she was getting
into.  When the Germans withdrew, as they would have to eventually,
the lot of a woman seen being friendly to a German officer would not
be easy.
But she seemed to have no more choice about it than he did. They
had been sucked into this relationship and were being pulled along
by forces that were stronger than either of them.  It was a fright-
ening thought.
The happiness she brought him only frightened him more.  The
brief spells of happiness he had had in the past few years had led
to more pain than he ever knew existed and left him with the sense
that no happiness could be worth the price.
The ringing of the phone startled him so much that it rang again
before he picked it up.
"You're right, my boy," Karl said after Hans asked the
required question.  "I should come.  To see what you have accom-
plished."  Then there was a clearly audible sigh.  "But things are
a bit chaotic here at the moment.  I can't come for a week or ten
days.  I'll have Pflueger call your Captain Schmidt in the morning
and arrange a definite date.  Is that all right?"
Hans hoped it was all right.  If things were "a bit chaotic,"
that had to mean trouble.  "Of course. Come any time, at your conve-
nience."
Sergei lowered Schmidt onto the bed, then stood with his hands
in the small of his back, stretching his muscles.  Schmidt was
heavier than he looked.
He didn't like any of it.  Schmidt was drunk and the colonel
looked exhausted, a very different man than the one who had come out
from behind the wind screen just a few hours before. Sergei knew
what had happened.  He had heard them as he approached and had
waited.  Though he thought it insane for a German officer to love a
French woman in such times, he had been pleased to see the colonel
so relaxed and so obviously happy.  That made it all the more unfor-
tunate to see him looking so tired and upset just a few hours later.
"What was it, old man," he said softly in Russian as he leaned over
to unbutton Schmidt's uniform jacket.  "What upset you so much that
you had to get drunk and upset the colonel?  You don't like upset-
ting the colonel.  You are far too fond of him."  He loosened
Schmidt's tie, then struggled to undo the small top button on his
shirt.  "I know you're upset about the French woman, but not that
upset."
He straightened up and looked around.  He had never been in
Schmidt's room, but it looked just as Schmidt's room would look.
It was uncluttered, almost spartan, except for a crocheted doily on
the small table beside his bed.  Precisely in the middle of that
doily a traveling leather double picture frame stood open like a
hinged icon.  The left hand picture was of an elderly man and woman
standing in front of a small store.  Schmidt looked so much like the
man that there was no doubt in Sergei's mind that these were
Schmidt's parents and that this was the store Schmidt felt he should
have been running because his father was really too old to be doing
it.  The other picture was of a round faced woman and two young
children.  The woman was pleasant looking, stocky and undoubtedly
strong with two uncompromising braids wrapped around her head.  She
had one hand on the shoulder of a girl who was no more than four or
five.  The child was leaning against her skirts looking shyly at the
camera.  The boy was older, perhaps seven, and he was standing
slightly apart, fists clenched, looking hard at the camera as if he
were angry, perhaps at his father for being away.  "You miss them,
don't you, Schmidt. All you want is for this war to be over so you
can go home and take care of them and let them take care of you."
He pulled off first one, then the other of Schmidt's boots. "You
know who you are when you're home."  He rolled Schmidt onto his side
and put a pillow half under his stomach to keep him that way.  There
was always the danger that he would vomit and Sergei didn't want him
to choke on it. "You don't know who you are here. Being an officer
doesn't suit you, even though you have a job you do very well."  He
lifted Scmidt's feet and pulled out the blanket that was neatly
folded at the foot of the bed. "Because you can never really be part
of the officer corps.  You don't belong.  It's why you talk to me.
I don't belong either."  He covered Schmidt with the blanket then
pulled up a comfortable chair, took off his own boots and sat back
with his feet on the end of the bed, preparing to watch until he was
sure Schmidt would be all right.  Instead, he fell asleep.
The next morning, a white-faced, unrepentant Schmidt came in and
informed Hans that the colonel general was coming the following
Thursday.  Then he insisted on standing while he heard Hans tell him
both as much and as little about the plotting as he dared.
At the end of Hans' recital, Schmidt nodded grimly and said
that all things considered, he preferred to stay, but with a pro-
viso.  He wanted nothing to do with any plot to kill anyone, even
the Fuehrer whom he had come to think the world might well be better
off without.  All the same, he couldn't be part of getting rid of
him.  And please, if it could be arranged, no more letters. If those
terms were acceptable, then he thought he would like to stay.
That was more than acceptable.  Thank you.
As Hans watched Schmidt's back go through the door, he had the
sorrowful feeling that things would never be the same again.

Chapter XV
Sylvie Laurence was on her knees in a small clearing next to the
river bank, smoothing out a picnic blanket when a familiar sound
made her sit back on her heels.  She looked up at a ragged V of
geese flying south and took comfort in the fact that at least some-
thing in life was as it had always been.  But the geese also told
her that winter was coming.  Just the thought of winter made her rub
her hands up and sown her upper arms.  It didn't help and she knew
nothing could.  The cold had taken root and she knew it wouldn't
leave until spring.
She cursed the geese for being able to fly south where it would
be warm, perhaps even far enough south so there would be no Germans.
She cursed the Allies for not coming across the Channel with the
geese, for waiting until the likelihood of winter storms meant they
couldn't come until spring.  They had already held on through three
long winters, each one worse than the last.  And now they were fac-
ing holding on through another.  They could only hold on through one
more at most.
At least Peter had come.  That was one.
She looked toward where he was sitting on the river bank with
his back to her, reading, a fishing pole stuck into a holder in the
ground beside him.  She found it hard to believe that he'd arrived
less than a week before. It was as if he'd always been there, teach-
ing Renee to use the radio and the others to use the equipment and
the explosives he'd brought with him.  Everyone liked him, except
Jacques.  He filled their house with his presence as well as his
size, talking, laughing, especially over the way even the biggest of
the spare clothes they kept were too small.  He was so easy to have
around, but he wasn't going to be around long.  Her hand brushed
hard at a piece of lint on the blanket.
Despite the way he was sitting there, apparently relaxed and
enjoying the day, she knew that he was impatient, anxious for
Jacques to get the information he needed so that he could get on
with whatever else it was that he was here to do.
She was grateful that some of that information was quite pre-
cise because precise information took time and she was not anxious
for him to go.  She knew it was ridiculous to feel that way.  Such
men simply appeared and then they disappeared, never to be seen
again.  That could break a woman's heart.
He wanted to know who commanded each of six different Wehrmacht
units around Caen and Falaise and where their headquarters were.
That puzzled her. London should have had that information already.
But he also wanted to know where those commanders went when they
were off duty, who usually went with them, and whether there were
women involved.
She thought that most of it ought to be easy to find out, at
least for Caen.  Someone had organized all sorts of people in Caen,
and Jacques had good connections there.
Though Peter had told them nothing, she knew why he needed the
information.  The uniform was perfect, down to the identity disc
which was worn and dented.  His papers were just as perfect.  She
had looked when he was out with her brother.  They were German Army
papers in the name of Pietr Jaeger, with signatures and black eagle
and swastika stamps all over them.  And the papers weren't new, or
at least they didn't look new.  They were worn, some of them
stained, and they had the sort of crease marks that come only when
papers have been unfolded and refolded many times over a long period
of time.  There was even a letter, hand written in German script.
Whoever had made those papers had done well by him.
He was going to a German army unit.  It was the only explana-
tion.
There was a hollow feeling in the pit of her stomach.
She supposed the way he dealt with the soldiers who had come
that first night should have been a consolation to her.  He had the
manner and his German had been perfect or the sergeant would have
known.  Even his French had a slight German accent, which she found
quite remarkable.  But then, she thought, Americans had come to
their country from all over the world, so there were bound to be
Americans who could speak any language almost perfectly.
Despite the papers and the German and his manner, she didn't see
how he could survive even one day in a German army unit.  No one was
that good.  There would always be some small thing that would give
him away.
She grabbed the picnic basket, and pulled it to her so hard that
she almost tipped it over.
Usually she loved being out in the woods but suddenly she didn't
like it at all.  Suddenly she thought it was stupid to have a fish-
ing line set out.  There were no fish, not at this time of day or
this time of year.  She opened the lid and pulled out two plates.
But that didn't matter either, she told herself, because all they
were supposed to look like was - She plunked a set of napkin-wrapped
silver onto each plate. - a happy French couple spending some time
alone together in the woods.  It made her even angrier that his
French was up to that, too, that he could pass for an Alsatian, and
that he had papers to cover that as well.
She couldn't get rid of the memory of how he looked that first
night, and she cursed herself for not being able to get his naked-
ness out of her mind.
She had never known a man before she married Henri and there had
been only one man since he died, an RAF pilot they had hidden for
three weeks until he could be moved on.  The whole time the pilot
was with them, she had lived in a state of suspension where time had
no meaning.  It had been a fool's paradise.  When he left, it was as
if the world had come to an end.   Never again, she had told herself
then.  She told herself that now.
She stood, dusted her hands off on the seat of her slacks and
looked down the path, willing Jacques to come so she'd have some-
thing besides Peter's nakedness to think about. At the same time,
she willed him not to come because when he did, Peter would leave
and Peter would die.
"It won't help, you know."  Peter sounded amused.  "That boy
friend of yours will get here when he gets here and not before."
She opened her mouth to object but was stilled by his soft,
urgent, "Quiet."   A knife appeared in his hand and she was thrust
aside so hard that she fell.
By the time she scrambled to her knees, he had blended into the
woods and a silence that even the birds seemed loathe to break.
She heard twigs cracking along the river bank and had to clasp
her hands between her thighs to hide their shaking. Jacques would
not come that way.  He would come straight down the path.
"It's Jacques,"  he said finally.
"Of course it's me."  Jacques finally appeared, looking even
more annoyed than he sounded.  "Where is he?"
"Right here."  Peter said.  "And next time - if there is a next
time - if you can't come at the appointed time and by the agreed-
upon route, be damn careful to announce yourself well in advance."
The knife was nowhere to be seen.  "Did you get the information?"
"Of course."
"Something to eat, Jacques?" Sylvie said to break the tension.
"There's enough for everyone."
Jacques' sullen silence pervaded everything.  He even ate
angrily, his teeth all but tearing off chunks of bread as his eyes
took in the fishing pole, the linen napkins and the special china
that fit into the picnic basket. "Trying to masquerade as love birds
trysting in solitude?"
"Do you have a better suggestion?" Peter asked.
Jacques glared at him but the American met his eyes easily and
it was Jacques who looked away, toward Sylvie who was concentrating
on cutting apples into very thin slices.
"Shall we get on with it?" Peter asked.
"The sooner the better."   Jacques started in, giving the infor-
mation at top speed.  The American listened carefully, stopping him
only to ask him to repeat information here, to clarify something
there.  Then, when he was done, Peter made him listen while he
repeated it all back.
Sylvie saw Jacques' face darken, saw his jaw working. His eyes
kept shifting toward her and then quickly away.  It made her anx-
ious.  When Jacques got this way, there was no telling what he would
do.
Finally Peter was done.  Jacques just sat there, looking from
one of them to the other.
"Is there anything else?" Peter asked him politely.
"No."  Jacques rose slowly.
Sylvie forgot everything as she saw the fishing pole jerk.  Then
it jerked again, this time so hard and fast that it almost pulled
the holder out of the bank.  She pointed and gave a little cry but
Peter was already moving.  He grabbed the pole with both hands and
whipped the tip up and back.  A large silver-bellied fish arced
through the air and landed on the ground where it flopped wildly.
He grabbed for it but it slithered loose and he had to grab
again. He was laughing and struggling with it until he managed to
get two fingers into a gill.  Then he lifted it in triumph.
"Would you like it, Jacques?"  His laughed as he saw Jacques
regarding the fish with obvious distaste.
"No, thank you," he said.  "When will you be leaving?"
"I don't know."  Peter put the fish into the creel.  It was big
enough so that the tail hung out. "Why?"   He fastened the peg
through the loop that held down the top with exaggerated care.
"I was wondering if you had all the information you need, that's
all.  Or if there was something else you wanted me to do."
"No.  That's all." Peter paused. "Thank you."
"You're welcome." Jacques gave a stiff jerk of his head toward
Peter and, ignoring Sylvie, stalked off.
Peter watched him disappear among the trees, then rose and
walked to where the path started, still watching.
"You don't trust him," Sylvie said when Jacques had disappeared.
"No, I don't."
She thought Peter was wise.  He couldn't trust Jacques because
Jacques didn't trust him.  Jacques wouldn't trust anyone where she
was concerned.
As she gathered up the picnic things, she felt his eyes on her
and it made her clumsy.
"It's not just him," Peter said quietly.  "I can't afford to
trust anyone."
"Not even me."  She lifted the blanket and shook it out, then
folded it and rolled it into a tight sausage shaped roll which she
tried to stuff under the handle of the basket.  It wouldn't go.
"Sylvie."
She continued the struggle.
He took the blanket from her.  "Listen to me.  It's not safe for
you or for anyone in your family if I tell you about what I'm here
to do."
"I know that."  She wasn't looking at him.
"I know you know," he said hastily.  "I didn't mean..."
She waved him off with an impatient hand.
"It's hard for me." He matched her impatience.  "I don't like
putting you and your family in so much danger.  I know your father
doesn't look at it that way.  He told me that all of you do what you
do for France and because what I do will also help to free France,
you are more than willing to help me in any way you can.
"But because I'm coming to know you and your family, it's
beginning to feel personal and I don't like that.  It's even more
dangerous when it gets personal."
He softened the blanket roll and stuck it under the handles of
the basket.  This time it went easily.   "Jacques doesn't like my
being at the house, does he."
She shrugged and looked around to see if they'd forgotten
anything.
"He shouldn't have asked when I was leaving.  There's no need
for him to know."
"You're right."  She was just standing there, basket in hand,
looking at the trees, the river, everywhere but at him.  "Our
fathers expect us to marry, have expected it since we were children.
Then I married Henri." She shrugged.  "Now they expect it again."
"Will you marry him?"
"No.  Jacques assumes I will, but then he always assumes too
much."
With that she was off and walking down the path, basket in hand.
"You will be back,"  Sylvie said.  It was half question, half
statement.
Peter was looking around the bedroom to make sure that he hadn't
forgotten anything.  But then her words sank in and he looked at her
in surprise.  "Of course I'll be back.  You have to radio for the
plane."  Then he was looking at her closely.  "What's wrong?"
"It's strange to see you in that uniform."
"It's strange to be in it.  It itches."  He pulled a wry smile
as he tugged at the collar, lifting it away from his neck at a place
where the skin was already red.
"I hate it."  There was a break in her voice.
He tipped up her chin to make her look at him and saw tears in
her eyes.  "What's this?"
She jerked her head away.  "I told you.  I hate seeing you in
that uniform!"
"If it upsets you so much ...  That's good, isn't it?  That
means it looks authentic."
"Yes.  It looks authentic, and so do you."
"Aren't I supposed to?"
"Of course."  Her chin came up and she was looking him in the
eye at last.  "And you're perfect."
"Then why are you so angry?"
She just shook her head.  He waited but when there was nothing
more, he picked up the duffel bag, and said stiffly, "I have to get
to the station."
"Be careful. What you're going to do is dangerous."  Her voice
was trembling.    "And it's no game.   Even if you stupid men treat
it that way, it's not a game!"
He looked down at her and was still looking down at her when he
dropped the bag and put his arms around her.  He held her to him.
"If I treat it like a game, it's just to make it playable.  If I
don't, if we all don't,  we'll be paralyzed from the start."
"I don't want you to die."
"I don't intend to die."
He felt her nod and she started to pull away.  But to his sur-
prise, instead of letting her go, he found himself lifting her chin
and kissing her, hard. It was an effort to stop and when he finally
did, his breath was coming in quick harsh rasps.  "You aren't mak-
ing this any easier for me."
"I didn't intend to."  She twisted free of his arms. "Just be
careful to come back."  With that she fled, leaving only the faint
warmth that had penetrated his coat and the sound of quick light
footsteps running away from him down the hall.
