              The summer soldiers and the sunshine patriots will,
          in this crisis, shrink from the service of their coun-
          try.

              Thomas Paine, in the Pennsylvania Journal, December
          l9th, l785




              Police work makes you skeptical about the human
          character.  It absolutely alerts you to the frailness
          of human nature.  But it also makes you aware there are
          these noblemen who're there in a crunch.  They're win-
          ter soldiers.  They march when the snow is on the
          ground.

              Chief of Police Anthony Bouza, as quoted in the
          Minneapolis Star and Tribune, September 2lst, l985.
